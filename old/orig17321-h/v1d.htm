<h2>
    CHAPTER VII&mdash;TEMPLES AND TOMBS OF THEBES
</h2>

<p>
We have seen that it was in the Theban period that Egypt emerged from
her isolation, and for the first time came into contact with Western
Asia. This grand turning-point in Egyptian history seemed to be the
appropriate place at which to pause in the description of our latest
knowledge of Egyptian history, in order to make known the results of
archaeological discovery in Mesopotamia and Western Asia generally. The
description has been carried down past the point of convergence of the
two originally isolated paths of Egyptian and Babylonian civilization,
and what new information the latest discoveries have communicated to us
on this subject has been told in the preceding chapters. We now have to
retrace our steps to the point where we left Egyptian history and resume
the thread of our Egyptian narrative.
</p>
<p>
The Hyksos conquest and the rise of Thebes are practically
contemporaneous. The conquest took place perhaps three or four hundred
years after the first advancement of Thebes to the position of capital
of Egypt, but it must be remembered that this position was not retained
during the time of the XIIth Dynasty. The kings of that dynasty, though
they were Thebans, did not reign at Thebes. Their royal city was in the
North, in the neighbourhood of Lisht and Mêdûm, where their pyramids
were erected, and their chief care was for the lake province of the
Fayyûm, which was largely the creation of Amenemhat III, the Moeris
of the Greeks. It was not till Thebes became the focus of the
national resistance to the Hyksos that its period of greatness began.
Henceforward it was the undisputed capital of Egypt, enlarged and
embellished by the care and munificence of a hundred kings, enriched by
the tribute of a hundred conquered nations.
</p>
<p>
But were we to confine ourselves to the consideration only of the latest
discoveries of Theban greatness after the expulsion of the Hyksos, we
should be omitting much that is of interest and importance. For the
Egyptians the first grand climacteric in their history (after the
foundation of the monarchy) was the transference of the royal power from
Memphis and Herakleopolis to a Theban house. The second, which followed
soon after, was the Hyksos invasion. The two are closely connected in
Theban history; it is Thebes that defeated Herakleopolis and conquered
Memphis; it is Theban power that was overthrown by the Hyksos; it is
Thebes that expelled them and initiated the second great period of
Egyptian history. We therefore resume our narrative at a point before
the great increase of Theban power at the time of the expulsion of the
Hyksos, and will trace this power from its rise, which followed
the defeat of Herakleopolis and Memphis. It is upon this epoch&mdash;the
beginning of Theban power&mdash;that the latest discoveries at Thebes have
thrown some new light.
</p>
<p>
More than anywhere else in Egypt excavations have been carried on at
Thebes, on the site of the ancient capital of the country. And here, if
anywhere, it might have been supposed that there was nothing more to be
found, no new thing to be exhumed from the soil, no new fact to be added
to our knowledge of Egyptian history. Yet here, no less than at Abydos,
has the archaeological exploration of the last few years been especially
successful, and we have seen that the ancient city of Thebes has a great
deal more to tell us than we had expected.
</p>
<p>
The most ancient remains at Thebes were discovered by Mr. Newberry in
the shape of two tombs of the VIth Dynasty, cut upon the face of the
well-known hill of Shêkh Abd el-Kûrna, on the west bank of the Nile
opposite Luxor. Every winter traveller to Egypt knows, well the ride
from the sandy shore opposite the Luxor temple, along the narrow pathway
between the gardens and the canal, across the bridges and over the
cultivated land to the Ramesseum, behind which rises Shêkh Abd el-Kûrna,
with its countless tombs, ranged in serried rows along the scarred and
scarped face of the hill. This hill, which is geologically a fragment of
the plateau behind which some gigantic landslip was sent sliding in the
direction of the river, leaving the picturesque gorge and cliffs of Dêr
el-Bahari to mark the place from which it was riven, was evidently the
seat of the oldest Theban necropolis. Here were the tombs of the Theban
chiefs in the period of the Old Kingdom, two of which have been found
by Mr. Newberry. In later times, it would seem, these tombs were largely
occupied and remodelled by the great nobles of the XVIIIth Dynasty, so
that now nearly all the tombs extant on Shêkh Abd el-Kûrna belong to
that dynasty.
</p>
<p>
Of the Thebes of the IXth and Xth Dynasties, when the Herakleopolites
ruled, we have in the British Museum two very remarkable statues&mdash;one of
which is here illustrated&mdash;of the steward of the palace, Mera. The tomb
from which they came is not known. Both are very beautiful examples
of the Egyptian sculptor's art, and are executed in a style eminently
characteristic of the transition period between the work of the Old and
Middle Kingdoms. As specimens of the art of the Hierakonpolite period,
of which we have hardly any examples, they are of the greatest interest.
Mera is represented wearing a different head-dress in each figure; in
one he has a short wig, in the other a skullcap.

</center>

<p>
When the Herakleopolite dominion was finally overthrown, in spite of the
valiant resistance of the princes of Asyût, and the Thebans assumed the
Pharaonic dignity, thus founding the XIth Dynasty, the Theban necropolis
was situated in the great bay in the cliffs, immediately north of Shêkh
Abd el-Kûrna, which is known as Dêr el-Bahari. In this picturesque part
of Western Thebes, in many respects perhaps the most picturesque
place in Egypt, the greatest king of the XIth Dynasty, Neb-hapet-Râ
Mentuhetep, excavated his tomb and built for the worship of his ghost
a funerary temple, which he called <i>Akh-aset</i>, "Glorious-is-its-
Situation," a name fully justified by its surroundings. This temple is
an entirely new discovery, made by Prof. Naville and Mr. Hall in 1903.
The results obtained up to date have been of very great importance,
especially with regard to the history of Egyptian art and architecture,
for our sources of information were few and we were previously not very
well informed as to the condition of art in the time of the XIth
Dynasty.
</p>
<p>
The new temple lies immediately to the south of the great XVIIIth
Dynasty temple at Dêr el-Bahari, which has always been known, and which
was excavated first by Mariette and later by Prof. Naville, for the
Egypt Exploration Fund. To the results of the later excavations we shall
return. When they were finally completed, in the year 1898, the great
XVIIIth Dynasty temple, which was built by Queen Hatshepsu, had been
entirely cleared of débris, and the colonnades had been partially
restored (under the care of Mr. Somers Clarke) in order to make a roof
under which to protect the sculptures on the walls. The whole mass of
débris, consisting largely of fallen <i>talus</i> from the cliffs above,
which had almost hidden the temple, was removed; but a large tract lying
to the south of the temple, which was also covered with similar mounds
of débris, was not touched, but remained to await further investigation.
It was here, beneath these heaps of débris, that the new temple was
found when work was resumed by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1903. The
actual tomb of the king has not yet been revealed, although that of
Neb-hetep Mentuhetep, who may have been his immediate predecessor,
was discovered by Mr. Carter in 1899. It was known, however, and still
uninjured in the reign of Ramses IX of the XXth Dynasty. Then, as we
learn from the report of the inspectors sent to examine the royal tombs,
which is preserved in the Abbott Papyrus, they found the <i>pyramid-tomb</i>
of King Xeb-hapet-Râ which is in Tjesret (the ancient Egyptian name for
Dêr el-Bahari); it was intact. We know, therefore, that it was intact
about 1000 B.C. The description of it as a pyramid-tomb is interesting,
for in the inscription of Tetu, the priest of Akh-aset, who was buried
at Abydos, Akh-aset is said to have been a pyramid. That the newly
discovered temple was called Akh-aset we know from several inscriptions
found in it. And the most remarkable thing about this temple is that in
its centre there was a pyramid. This must be the pyramid-tomb which was
found intact by the inspectors, so that the tomb itself must be close
by. But it does not seem to have been beneath the pyramid, below which
is only solid rock. It is perhaps a gallery cut in the cliffs at the
back of the temple.
</p>
<p>
The pyramid was then a dummy, made of rubble within a revetment of heavy
flint nodules, which was faced with fine limestone. It was erected on a
pyloni-form base with heavy cornice of the usual Egyptian pattern. This
central pyramid was surrounded by a roofed hall or ambulatory of small
octagonal pillars, the outside wall of which was decorated with coloured
reliefs, depicting various scenes connected with the <i>sed-heb</i> or
jubilee-festival of the king, processions of the warriors and magnates
of the realm, scenes of husbandry, boat-building, and so forth, all of
which were considered appropriate to the chapel of a royal tomb at that
period. Outside this wall was an open colonnade of square pillars.
The whole of this was built upon an artificially squared rectangular
platform of natural rock, about fifteen feet high. To north and south of
this were open courts. The southern is bounded by the hill; the northern
is now bounded by the Great Temple of Hat-shepsu, but, before this was
built, there was evidently a very large open court here. The face of the
rock platform is masked by a wall of large rectangular blocks of fine
white limestone, some of which measure six feet by three feet six
inches. They are beautifully squared and laid in bonded courses of
alternate sizes, and the walls generally may be said to be among the
finest yet found in Egypt. We have already remarked that the architects
of the Middle Kingdom appear to have been specially fond of fine masonry
in white stone. The contrast between these splendid XIth Dynasty walls,
with their great base-stones of sandstone, and the bad rough masonry of
the XVIIIth Dynasty temple close by, is striking. The XVIIIth Dynasty
architects and masons had degenerated considerably from the standard of
the Middle Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
This rock platform was approached from the east in the centre by an
inclined plane or ramp, of which part of the original pavement of wooden
beams remains <i>in situ</i>.

</pre>
<p>
To right and left of this ramp are colonnades, each of twenty-two square
pillars, all inscribed with the name and titles of Mentuhetep. The walls
masking the platform in these colonnades were sculptured with various
scenes, chiefly representing boat processions and campaigns against the
Aamu or nomads of the Sinaitic peninsula. The design of the colonnades
is the same as that of the Great Temple, and the whole plan of this
part, with its platform approached by a ramp flanked by colonnades,
is so like that of the Great Temple that we cannot but assume that the
peculiar design of the latter, with its tiers of platforms approached by
ramps flanked by colonnades, is not an original idea, but was directly
copied by the XVIIIth Dynasty architects from the older XIth Dynasty
temple which they found at Dêr el-Bahari when they began their work.

</pre>
<p>
The supposed originality of Hatshepsu's temple is then non-existent;
it was a copy of the older design, in fact, a magnificent piece of
archaism. But Hatshepsu's architects copied this feature only; the
actual arrangements <i>on</i> the platforms in the two temples are as
different as they can possibly be. In the older we have a central
pyramid with a colonnade round it, in the newer may be found an open
court in front of rock-cave shrines.

</center>

<p>
Before the XIth Dynasty temple was set up a series of statues of King
Mentuhetep and of a later king, Amenhetep I, in the form of Osiris, like
those of Usertsen (Senusret) I at Lisht already mentioned. One of these
statues is in the British Museum. In the south court were discovered
six statues of King Usertsen (Senusret) III, depicting him at different
periods of his life. Pour of the heads are preserved, and, as the
expression of each differs from that of the other, it is quite evident
that some show him as a young, others as an old, man.

<p>
The face is of the well-known hard and lined type which is seen also in
the portraits of Amenemhat III, and was formerly considered to be that
of the Hyksos. Messrs. Newberry and Garstang, as we have seen, consider
it to be so, indirectly, as they regard the type as having been
introduced into the XIIth Dynasty by Queen Nefret, the mother of
Usertsen (Sen-usret) III. This queen, they think, <i>was</i> a Hittite
princess, and the Hittites were practically the same thing as the
Hyksos. We have seen, however, that there is very little foundation for
this view, and it is more than probable that this peculiar physiognomy
is of a type purely Egyptian in character.

<pre>
     On The Platform Of The XIth Dynasty Temple, Der El-Bahari,
     1904.
</pre>
<p>
On the platform, around the central pyramid, were buried in small
chamber-tombs a number of priestesses of the goddess Hathor, the
mistress of the desert and special deity of Dêr el-Bahari. They were
all members of the king's harîm, and they bore the title of "King's
Favourite." As told in a previous chapter, all were buried at one
time, before the final completion of the temple, and it is by no means
impossible that they were strangled at the king's death and buried round
him in order that their ghosts might accompany him in the next world,
just as the slaves were buried around the graves (or secondary graves)
of the 1st Dynasty kings at Aby-dos. They themselves, as also already
related, took with them to the next world little waxen figures which
when called upon could by magic be turned into ghostly slaves. These
images were <i>ushabtiu,</i> "answerers," the predecessors of the little
figures of wood, stone, and pottery which are found buried with the
dead in later times. The priestesses themselves were, so to speak, human
<i>ushabtiu,</i> for royal use only, and accompanied the kings to their final
resting-place.
</p>
<p>
With the priestesses was buried the usual funerary furniture
characteristic of the period. This consisted of little models of
granaries with the peasants bringing in the corn, models of bakers and
brewers at work, boats with their crews, etc., just as we find them
in the XIth and XIIth Dynasty tombs at el-Bersha and Beni Hasan. These
models, too, were supposed to be transformed by magic into actual
workmen who would work for the deceased, heap up grain for her, brew
beer for her, ferry her over the ghostly Nile into the tomb-world, or
perform any other services required.
</p>
<p>
Some of the stone sarcophagi of the priestesses are very elaborately
decorated with carved and painted reliefs depicting each deceased
receiving offerings from priests, one of whom milks the holy cows of
Hathor to give her milk. The sarcophagi were let down into the tomb in
pieces and there joined together, and they have been removed in the same
way. The finest is a unique example of XIth Dynasty art, and it is now
preserved in the Museum of Cairo.

<p>
In memory of the priestesses there were erected on the platform behind
the pyramid a number of small shrines, which were decorated with the
most delicately coloured carvings in high relief, representing chiefly
the same subjects as those on the sarcophagi. The peculiar style of
these reliefs was previously unknown. In connection with them a most
interesting possibility presents itself.

We know the name of the chief artist of Mentuhetep's reign. He was
called Mertisen, and he thus describes himself on his tombstone from
Abydos, now in the Louvre: "I was an artist skilled in my art. I knew
my art, how to represent the forms of going forth and returning, so that
each limb may be in its proper place. I knew how the figure of a man
should walk and the carriage of a woman, the poising of the arm to
bring the hippopotamus low, the going of the runner. I knew how to make
amulets, which enable us to go without fire burning us and without the
flood washing us away. No man could do this but I, and the eldest son
of my body. Him has the god decreed to excel in art, and I have seen
the perfections of the work of his hands in every kind of rare stone,
in gold and silver, in ivory and ebony." Now since Mertisen and his son
were the chief artists of their day, it is more than probable that they
were employed to decorate their king's funerary chapel. So that in all
probability the XIth Dynasty reliefs from Dêr el-Bahari are the work
of Mertisen and his son, and in them we see the actual "forms of going
forth and returning, the poising of the arm to bring the hippopotamus
low, the going of the runner," to which he refers on his tombstone. This
adds a note of personal interest to the reliefs, an interest which is
often sadly wanting in Egypt, where we rarely know the names of the
great artists whose works we admire so much. We have recovered the names
of the sculptor and painter of Seti I's temple at Abydos and that of the
sculptor of some of the tombs at Tell el-Amarna, but otherwise very few
names of the artists are directly associated with the temples and tombs
which they decorated, and of the architects we know little more. The
great temple of Dêr el-Bahari was, however, we know, designed by Senmut,
the chief architect to Queen Hatshepsu.
</p>
<p>
It is noticeable that Mertisen's art, if it is Mertisen's, is of a
peculiar character. It is not quite so fully developed as that of the
succeeding XIIth Dynasty. The drawing of the figures is often peculiar,
strange lanky forms taking the place of the perfect proportions of the
IVth-VIth and the XIIth Dynasty styles. Great elaboration is bestowed
upon decoration, which is again of a type rather archaic in character
when compared with that of the XIIth Dynasty. We are often reminded of
the rude sculptures which used to be regarded as typical of the art of
the XIth Dynasty, while at the same time we find work which could not
be surpassed by the best XIIth Dynasty masters. In fact, the art of
Neb-hapet-Râ's reign was the art of a transitional period. Under the
decadent Memphites of the VIIth and VIIIth Dynasties, Egyptian art
rapidly fell from the high estate which it had attained under the Vth
Dynasty, and, though good work was done under the Hierakonpolites, the
chief characteristic of Egyptian art at the time of the Xth and early
XIth Dynasties is its curious roughness and almost barbaric appearance.
When, however, the kings of the XIth Dynasty reunited the whole land
under one sceptre, and the long reign of Neb-hapet-Râ Mentuhetep enabled
the reconsolidation of the realm to be carried out by one hand, art
began to revive, and, just as to Neb-hapet-Râ must be attributed the
renascence of the Egyptian state under the hegemony of Thebes, so must
the revival of art in his reign be attributed to his great artists,
Mertisen and his son. They carried out in the realm of art what their
king had carried out in the political realm, and to them must be
attributed the origin of the art of the Middle Kingdom which under the
XIIth Dynasty attained so high a pitch of excellence. The sculptures
of the king's temple at Dêr el-Bahari, then, are monuments of the
renascence of Egyptian art, after the state of decadence into which it
had fallen during the long civil wars between South and North; it is
a reviving art, struggling out of barbarism to regain perfection, and
therefore has much about it that seems archaic, stiff, and curious when
compared with later work. To the XVIIIth Dynasty Egyptian it would no
doubt have seemed hopelessly old-fashioned and even semi-barbarous, and
he had no qualms about sweeping it aside whenever it appeared in the
way of the work of his own time; but to us this very strangeness
gives additional charm and interest, and we can only be thankful that
Mertisen's work has lasted (in fragments only, it is true) to our own
day, to tell us the story of a little known chapter in the history of
ancient Egyptian art.
</p>
<p>
From this description it will have been seen that the temple is an
important monument of the Egyptian art and architecture of the Middle
Kingdom. It is the only temple of that period of which considerable
traces have been found, and on that account the study of it will be of
the greatest interest. It is the best preserved of the older temples of
Egypt, and at Thebes it is by far the most ancient building recovered.
Historically it has given us a new king of the XIth Dynasty,
Sekhâhe-tep-Râ Mentuhetep, and the name of the queen of Neb-hapet-Râ
Mentuhetep, Aasheit, who seems to have been an Ethiopian, to judge from
her portrait, which has been discovered. It is interesting to note that
one of the priestesses was a negress.
</p>
<p>
The name Neb-hapet-Râ may be unfamiliar to those readers who are
acquainted with the lists of the Egyptian kings. It is a correction
of the former reading, "Neb-kheru-Râ," which is now known from these
excavations to be erroneous. Neb-hapet-Râ (or, as he used to be called,
Neb-kheru-Râ) is Mentuhetep III of Prof. Petrie's arrangement. Before
him there seem to have come the kings Mentuhetep Neb-hetep (who is also
commemorated in this temple) and Neb-taui-Râ; after him, Sekhâhetep-Râ
Mentuhetep IV and Seânkhkarâ Mentuhetep V, who were followed by an
Antef, bearing the banner or hawk-name Uah-ânkh. This king was followed
by Amenemhat I, the first king of the XIIth Dynasty. Antef Uah-ânkh may
be numbered Antef I, as the prince Antefa, who founded the XIth Dynasty,
did not assume the title of king.
</p>
<p>
Other kings of the name of Antef also ruled over Egypt, and they used to
be regarded as belonging to the XIth Dynasty; but Prof. Steindorff
has now proved that they really reigned after the XIIIth Dynasty, and
immediately before the Sekenenrâs, who were the fighters of the Hyksos
and predecessors of the XVIIIth Dynasty. The second names of Antef III
(Seshes-Râ-up-maat) and Antef IV (Seshes-Râ-her-her-maat) are exactly
similar to those of the XIIIth Dynasty kings and quite unlike those of
the Mentuheteps; also at Koptos a decree of Antef II (Nub-kheper-Râ) has
been found inscribed on a doorway of Usertsen (Senusret) I; so that
he cannot have preceded him. Prof. Petrie does not yet accept these
conclusions, and classes all the Antefs together with the Mentuheteps in
the XIth Dynasty. He considers that he has evidence from Herakleopolis
that Antef Xub-kheper-Râ (whom he numbers Antef V) preceded the XIIth
Dynasty, and he supposes that the decree of Nub-kheper-Râ at Koptos is
a later copy of the original and was inscribed during the XIIth Dynasty.
But this is a difficult saying. The probabilities are that Prof.
Steindorff is right. Antef Uah-ânkh must, however, have preceded the
XIIth Dynasty, since an official of that period refers to his father's
father as having lived in Uah-ânkh 's time.
</p>
<p>
The necropolis of Dêr el-Bahari was no doubt used all through the period
of the XIth and XIIth Dynasties, and many tombs of that period have been
found there. A large number of these were obliterated by the building
of the great temple of Queen Hatshepsu, in the northern part of the
cliff-bay. We know of one queen's tomb of that period which runs right
underneath this temple from the north, and there is another that is
entered at the south side which also runs down underneath it. Several
tombs were likewise found in the court between it and the XIth Dynasty
temple. We know that the XVIIIth Dynasty temple was largely built over
this court, and we can see now the XIth Dynasty mask-wall on the west of
the court running northwards underneath the mass of the XVIIIth Dynasty
temple. In all probability, then, when the temple of Hatshepsu
was built, the larger portion of the Middle Kingdom necropolis (of
chamber-tombs reached by pits), which had filled up the bay to the north
of the Mentuhetep temple, was covered up and obliterated, just as
the older VIth Dynasty gallery tombs of Shêkh Abd el-Kûrna had been
appropriated and altered at the same period.
</p>
<p>
The kings of the XIIth and XIIIth Dynasties were not buried at Thebes,
as we have seen, but in the North, at Dashûr, Lisht, and near the
Fayymn, with which their royal city at Itht-taui had brought them into
contact. But at the end of the XIIIth Dynasty the great invasion of the
Hyksos probably occurred, and all Northern Egypt fell under the Arab
sway. The native kings were driven south from the Fayymn to Abydos,
Koptos, and Thebes, and at Thebes they were buried, in a new necropolis
to the north of Dêr el-Bahari (probably then full), on the flank of a
long spur of hill which is now called Dra' Abu-'l-Negga, "Abu-'l-Negga's
Arm." Here the Theban kings of the period between the XIIIth and XVIIth
Dynasties, Upuantemsaf, Antef Nub-kheper-Râ, and his descendants, Antefs
III and IV, were buried. In their time the pressure of foreign invasion
seems to have been felt, for, to judge from their coffins, which show
progressive degeneration of style and workmanship, poverty now afflicted
Upper Egypt and art had fallen sadly from the high standard which it had
reached in the days of the XIth and XIIth Dynasties. Probably the later
Antefs and Sebekemsafs were vassals of the Hyksos. Their descendants
of the XVIIth Dynasty were buried in the same necropolis of Dra'
Abu-'l-Negga, and so were the first two kings of the XVIIIth Dynasty,
Aahmes and Amenhetep I. The tombs of the last two have not yet been
found, but we know from the Abbott Papyrus that Amenhetep's was
here, for, like that of Menttihetep III, it was found intact by the
inspectors. It was a gallery-tomb of very great length, and will be a
most interesting find when it is discovered, as it no doubt eventually
will be. Aahmes had a tomb at Abydos, which was discovered by Mr.
Currelly, working for the Egypt Exploration Fund. This, however, like
the Abydene tomb of Usert-sen (Senusret) III, was in all likelihood a
sham or secondary tomb, the king having most probably been buried at
Thebes, in the Dra' Abu-'l-Negga. The Abydos tomb is of interesting
construction. The entrance is by a simple pit, from which a gallery
runs round in a curving direction to a great hall supported by eighteen
square pillars, beyond which is a further gallery which was never
finished. Nothing was found in the tomb. On the slope of the mountain,
due west of and in a line with the tomb, Mr. Currelly found a
terrace-temple analogous to those of Dêr el-Bahari, approached not
by means of a ramp but by stairways at the side. It was evidently the
funerary temple of the tomb.

<p>
The secondary tomb of Usertsen (Senusret) III at Abydos, which has
already been mentioned, was discovered in the preceding year by Mr. A.
E. P. Weigall, and excavated by Mr. Currelly in 1903. It lies north of
the Aahmes temple, between it and the main cemetery of Abydos. It is a
great <i>bâb</i> or gallery-tomb, like those of the later kings at Thebes,
with the usual apparatus of granite plugs, barriers, pits, etc., to
defy plunderers. The tomb had been plundered, nevertheless, though it is
probable that the robbers were vastly disappointed with what they
found in it. Mr. Currelly ascribes the absence of all remains to the
plunderers, but the fact is that there probably never was anything in
it but an empty sarcophagus. Near the tomb Mr. Weigall discovered
some dummy mastabas, a find of great interest. Just as the king had a
secondary tomb, so secondary mastabas, mere dummies of rubble like the
XIth Dynasty pyramid at Dêr el-Bahari, were erected beside it to look
like the tombs of his courtiers. Some curious sinuous brick walls which
appear to act as dividing lines form a remarkable feature of this sham
cemetery. In a line with the tomb, on the edge of the cultivation,
is the funerary temple belonging to it, which was found by Mr.
Randall-Maclver in 1900. Nothing remains but the bases of the fluted
limestone columns and some brick walls. A headless statue of Usertsen
was found.
</p>
<p>
We have an interesting example of the custom of building a secondary
tomb for royalties in these two nécropoles of Dra' Abu-'l-Negga and
Abydos. Queen Teta-shera, the grandmother of Aahmes, a beautiful
statuette of whom may be seen in the British Museum, had a small pyramid
at Abydos, eastward of and in a line with the temple and secondary tomb
of Aahmes. In 1901 Mr. Mace attempted to find the chamber, but could
not. In the next year Mr. Currelly found between it and the Aahmes
tomb a small chapel, containing a splendid stele, on which Aahmes
commemorates his grandmother, who, he says, was buried at Thebes and had
a <i>mer-âhât</i> at Abydos, and he records his determination to build her
also a pyramid at Abydos, out of his love and veneration for her memory.
It thus appeared that the pyramid to the east was simply a dummy,
like Usertsen's mastabas, or the Mentuhetep pyramid at Dêr el-Bahari.
Teta-shera was actually buried at Dra' Abu-'l-Negga. Her secondary
pyramid, like that of Aahmes himself, was in the "holy ground" at
Abydos, though it was not an imitation <i>bâb</i>, but a dummy pyramid of
rubble. This well illustrates the whole custom of the royal primary and
secondary tombs, which, as we have seen, had obtained in the case of
royal personages from the time of the 1st Dynasty, when Aha had two
tombs, one at Nakâda and the other at Abydos. It is probable that all
the 1st Dynasty tombs at Abydos are secondary, the kings being really
buried elsewhere. After their time we know for certain that Tjeser and
Snefru had duplicate tombs, possibly also Unas, and certainly Usertsen
(Senusret) III, Amenemhat III, and Aahmes; while Mentuhetep III and
Queen Teta-shera had dummy pyramids as well as their tombs. Ramses III
also had two tombs, both at Thebes. The reasons for this custom were
two: first, the desire to elude plunderers, and second, the wish to give
the ghost a <i>pied-à-terre</i> on the sacred soil of Abydos or Sakkâra.
</p>
<p>
As the inscription of Aahmes which records the building of the dummy
pyramid of Teta-shera is of considerable interest, it may here be
translated. The text reads: "It came to pass that when his Majesty the
king, even the king of South and North, Neb-pehti-Râ, Son of the Sun,
Aahmes, Giver of Life, was taking his pleasure in the <i>tjadu</i>-hall,
the hereditary princess greatly favoured and greatly prized, the king's
daughter, the king's sister, the god's wife and great wife of the king,
Nefret-ari-Aahmes, the living, was in the presence of his Majesty. And
the one spake unto the other, seeking to do honour to These There,*
which consisteth in the pouring of water, the offering upon the altar,
the painting of the stele at the beginning of each season, at the
Festival of the New Moon, at the feast of the month, the feast of the
going-forth of the <i>Sem</i>-priest, the Ceremonies of the Night, the Feasts
of the Fifth Day of the Month and of the Sixth, the <i>Hak</i>-festival, the
<i>Uag</i>-festival, the feast of Thoth, the beginning of every season of
heaven and earth. And his sister spake, answering him: 'Why hath one
remembered these matters, and wherefore hath this word been said?
Prithee, what hath come into thy heart?' The king spake, saying: 'As for
me, I have remembered the mother of my mother, the mother of my father,
the king's great wife and king's mother Teta-shera, deceased, whose
tomb-chamber and <i>mer-ahât</i> are at this moment upon the soil of Thebes
and Abydos. I have spoken thus unto thee because my Majesty desireth to
cause a pyramid and chapel to be made for her in the Sacred Land, as a
gift of a monument from my Majesty, and that its lake should be dug, its
trees planted, and its offerings prescribed; that it should be provided
with slaves, furnished with lands, and endowed with cattle, with
<i>hen-ka</i> priests and <i>kher-heb</i> priests performing their duties, each
man knowing what he hath to do.' Behold! when his Majesty had thus
spoken, these things were immediately carried out. His Majesty did these
things on account of the greatness of the love which he bore her, which
was greater than anything. Never had ancestral kings done the like for
their mothers. Behold! his Majesty extended his arm and bent his hand,
and made for her the king's offering to Geb, to the Ennead of Gods, to
the lesser Ennead of Gods... [to Anubis] in the God's Shrine, thousands
of offerings of bread, beer, oxen, geese, cattle... to [the Queen
Teta-shera]." This is one of the most interesting inscriptions
discovered in Egypt in recent years, for the picturesqueness of its
diction is unusual.

<p>
As has already been said, the king Amenhetep I was also buried in the
Dra' Abu-'l-Negga, but the tomb has not yet been found. Amenhetep I and
his mother, Queen Nefret-ari-Aahmes, who is mentioned in the inscription
translated above, were both venerated as tutelary demons of the Western
Necropolis of Thebes after their deaths, as also was Mentuhetep III. At
Dêr el-Bahari both kings seem to have been worshipped with Hathor, the
Mistress of the Waste. The worship of Amen-Râ in the XVIIIth Dynasty
temple of Dêr el-Bahari was a novelty introduced by the priests of Amen
at that time. But the worship of Hathor went on side by side with that
of Amen in a chapel with a rock-cut shrine at the side of the Great
Temple. Very possibly this was the original cave-shrine of Hathor, long
before Mentuhetep's time, and was incorporated with the Great Temple and
beautified with the addition of a pillared hall before it, built
over part of the XIth Dynasty north court and wall, by Hatshepsu's
architects.
</p>
<p>
The Great Temple, the excavation of which for the Egypt Exploration Fund
was successfully brought to an end by Prof. Naville in 1898, was erected
by Queen Hatshepsu in honour of Amen-Râ, her father Thothmes I, and her
brother-husband Thothmes II, and received a few additions from Thothmes
III, her successor. He, however, did not complete it, and it fell into
disrepair, besides suffering from the iconoclastic zeal of the heretic
Akhunaten, who hammered out some of the beautifully painted scenes upon
its walls. These were badly restored by Ramses II, whose painting is
easily distinguished from the original work by the dulness and badness
of its colour.
</p>
<p>
The peculiar plan and other remarkable characteristics of this temple
are well known. Its great terraces, with the ramps leading up to them,
flanked by colonnades, which, as we have seen, were imitated from the
design of the old XIth Dynasty temple at its side, are familiar from a
hundred illustrations, and the marvellously preserved colouring of its
delicate reliefs is known to every winter visitor to Egypt, and can be
realized by those who have never been there through the medium of Mr.
Howard Carter's wonderful coloured reproductions, published in Prof.
Naville's edition of the temple by the Egypt Exploration Fund. The Great
Temple stands to-day clear of all the débris which used to cover it, a
lasting monument to the work of the greatest of the societies which busy
themselves with the unearthing of the relics of the ancient world.

The two temples of Dêr el-Bahari will soon stand side by side, as they
originally stood, and will always be associated with the name of the
society which rescued them from oblivion, and gave us the treasures
of the royal tombs at Abydos. The names of the two men whom the Egypt
Exploration Fund commissioned to excavate Dêr el-Bahari and Abydos, and
for whose work it exclusively supplied the funds, Profs. Naville and
Petrie, will live chiefly in connection with their work at Dêr el-Bahari
and Abydos.
</p>
<p>
The Egyptians called the two temples <i>Tjeserti</i>, "the two holy places,"
the new building receiving the name of <i>Tjeser-tjesru</i>, "Holy of
Holies," and the whole tract of Dêr el-Bahari the appellation <i>Tjesret</i>,
"the Holy." The extraordinary beauty of the situation in which they are
placed, with its huge cliffs and rugged hillsides, may be appreciated
from the photograph which is taken from a steep path half-way up the
cliff above the Great Temple. In it we see the Great Temple in the
foreground with the modern roofs of two of its colonnades, devised in
order to protect the sculptures beneath them, the great trilithon gate
leading to the upper court, and the entrance to the cave-shrine of
Amen-Râ, with the niches of the kings on either side, immediately at the
foot of the cliff. In the middle distance is the duller form of the XIth
Dynasty temple, with its rectangular platform, the ramp leading up
to it, and the pyramid in the centre of it, surrounded by pillars,
half-emerging from the great heaps of sand and débris all around. The
background of cliffs and hills, as seen in the photograph, will serve to
give some idea of the beauty of the surroundings,&mdash;an arid beauty, it is
true, for all is desert. There is not a blade of vegetation near; all
is salmon-red in colour beneath a sky of ineffable blue, and against the
red cliffs the white temple stands out in vivid contrast.
</p>

The second illustration gives a nearer view of the great trilithon
gate in the upper court, at the head of the ramp. The long hill of Dra'
Abu-'l-Negga is seen bending away northward behind the gate.

This is the famous gate on which the jealous Thothmes III chiselled out
Hatshepsu's name in the royal cartouches and inserted his own in
its place; but he forgot to alter the gender of the pronouns in the
accompanying inscription, which therefore reads "King Thothmes III, she
made this monument to her father Amen."
</p>
<p>
Among Prof. Naville's discoveries here one of the most important is that
of the altar in a small court to the north, which, as the inscription
says, was made in honour of the god Râ-Harmachis "of beautiful white
stone of Anu." It is of the finest white limestone known. Here also were
found the carved ebony doors of a shrine, now in the Cairo Museum. One
of the most beautiful parts of the temple is the Shrine of Anubis, with
its splendidly preserved paintings and perfect columns and roof of
white limestone. The effect of the pure white stone and simplicity of
architecture is almost Hellenic.
</p>
<p>
The Shrine of Hathor has been known since the time of Mariette, but in
connection with it some interesting discoveries have been made during
the excavation of the XIth Dynasty temple. In the court between the two
temples were found a large number of small votive offerings, consisting
of scarabs, beads, little figures of cows and women, etc., of blue
glazed <i>faïence</i> and rough pottery, bronze and wood, and blue glazed
ware ears, eyes, and plaques with figures of the sacred cow, and other
small objects of the same nature. These are evidently the ex-votos of
the XVIIIth Dynasty fellahîn to the goddess Hathor in the rock-shrine
above the court. When the shrine was full or the little ex-votos broken,
the sacristans threw them over the wall into the court below, which thus
became a kind of dust-heap. Over this heap the sand and débris gradually
collected, and thus they were preserved. The objects found are of
considerable interest to anthropological science.
</p>
<p>
The Great Temple was built, as we have said, in honour of Thothmes I
and II, and the deities Amen-Râ and Hathor. More especially it was the
funerary chapel of Thothmes I. His tomb was excavated, not in the Dra'
Abu-l-Negga, which was doubtless now too near the capital city and not
in a sufficiently dignified position of aloofness from the common herd,
but at the end of the long valley of the Wadiyên, behind the cliff-hill
above Dêr el-Bahari. Hence the new temple was oriented in the direction
of his tomb. Immediately behind the temple, on the other side of the
hill, is the tomb which was discovered by Lepsius and cleared in 1904
for Mr. Theodore N. Davis by Mr. Howard Carter, then chief inspector of
antiquities at Thebes. Its gallery is of very small dimensions, and it
winds about in the hill in corkscrew fashion like the tomb of Aahmes at
Aby-dos. Owing to its extraordinary length, the heat and foul air in the
depths of the tomb were almost insupportable and caused great difficulty
to the excavators. When the sarcophagus-chamber was at length reached,
it was found to contain the empty sarcophagi of Thothmes I and of
Hatshepsu. The bodies had been removed for safe-keeping in the time of
the XXIst Dynasty, that of Thothmes I having been found with those
of Set! I and Ramses II in the famous pit at Dêr el-Bahari, which was
discovered by M. Maspero in 1881. Thothmes I seems to have had another
and more elaborate tomb (No. 38) in the Valley of the Tombs of the
Kings, which was discovered by M. Loret in 1898. Its frescoes had been
destroyed by the infiltration of water.
</p>
<p>
The fashion of royal burial in the great valley behind Dêr el-Bahari
was followed during the XVIIIth, XIXth, and XXth Dynasties. Here in the
eastern branch of the Wadiyên, now called the <i>Bibân el-Mulûk</i>, "the
Tombs of the Kings," the greater number of the mightiest Theban Pharaohs
were buried. In the western valley rested two of the kings of the
XVIIIth Dynasty, who desired even more remote burial-places, Amenhetep
III and Ai. The former chose for his last home a most kingly site.
Ancient kings had raised great pyramids of artificial stone over their
graves. Amenhetep, perhaps the greatest and most powerful Pharaoh of
them all, chose to have a natural pyramid for his grave, a mountain for
his tumulus. The illustration shows us the tomb of this monarch, opening
out of the side of one of the most imposing hills in the Western Valley.
No other king but Amenhetep rested beneath this hill, which thus marks
his grave and his only.
</p>
<p>
It is in the Eastern Valley, the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings
properly speaking, that the tombs of Thothmes I and Hatshepsu lie, and
here the most recent discoveries have been made. It is a desolate spot.
As we come over the hill from Dêr el-Bahari we see below us in the
glaring sunshine a rocky canon, with sides sometimes sheer cliff,
sometimes sloped by great falls of rock in past ages. At the bottom
of these slopes the square openings of the many royal tombs can be
descried. [See illustration.] Far below we see the forms of tourists
and the tomb-guards accompanying them, moving in and out of the openings
like ants going in and out of an ants' nest. Nothing is heard but the
occasional cry of a kite and the ceaseless rhythmical throbbing of the
exhaust-pipe of the electric light engine in the unfinished tomb of
Ramses XI. Above and around are the red desert hills. The Egyptians
called it "The Place of Eternity."

<p>
In this valley some remarkable discoveries have been made during the
last few years. In 1898 M. Grébaut discovered the tomb of Amenhetep
II, in which was found the mummy of the king, intact, lying in its
sarcophagus in the depths of the tomb. The royal body now lies there
for all to see. The tomb is lighted with electricity, as are all the
principal tombs of the kings. At the head of the sarcophagus is a single
lamp, and, when the party of visitors is collected in silence around the
place of death, all the lights are turned out, and then the single
light is switched on, showing the royal head illuminated against the
surrounding blackness. The effect is indescribably weird and impressive.
The body has only twice been removed from the tomb since its burial, the
second time when it was for a brief space taken up into the sunlight to
be photographed by Mr.. Carter, in January, 1902. The temporary removal
was carefully carried out, the body of his Majesty being borne up
through the passages of the tomb on the shoulders of the Italian
electric light workmen, preceded and followed by impassive Arab
candle-bearers. The workmen were most reverent in their handling of the
body of "<i> il gran ré</i>," as they called him.
</p>
<p>
In the tomb were found some very interesting objects, including a model
boat (afterwards stolen), across which lay the body of a woman. This
body now lies, with others found close by, in a side chamber of the
tomb. One may be that of Hatshepsu. The walls of the tomb-chamber are
painted to resemble papyrus, and on them are written chapters of the
"Book of What Is in the Underworld," for the guidance of the royal
ghost.
</p>
<p>
In 1902-3 Mr. Theodore Davis excavated the tomb of Thothmes IV. It
yielded a rich harvest of antiquities belonging to the funeral state of
the king, including a chariot with sides of embossed and gilded leather,
decorated with representations of the king's warlike deeds, and much
fine blue pottery, all of which are now in the Cairo Museum. The
tomb-gallery returns upon itself, describing a curve. An interesting
point with regard to it is that it had evidently been violated even in
the short time between the reigns of its owner and Horem-heb, probably
in the period of anarchy which prevailed at Thebes during the reign
of the heretic Akhunaten; for in one of the chambers is a hieratic
inscription recording the repair of the tomb in the eighth year of
Horemheb by Maya, superintendent of works in the Tombs of the Kings. It
reads as follows: "In the eighth year, the third month of summer, under
the Majesty of King Tjeser-khepru-Râ Sotp-n-Râ, Son of the Sun, Horemheb
Meriamen, his Majesty (Life, health, and wealth unto him!) commanded
that orders should be sent unto the Fanbearer on the King's Left Hand,
the King's Scribe and Overseer of the Treasury, the Overseer of the
Works in the Place of Eternity, the Leader of the Festivals of Amen
in Karnak, Maya, son of the judge Aui, born of the Lady Ueret, that he
should renew the burial of King Men-khepru-Râ, deceased, in the August
Habitation in Western Thebes." Men-khepru-Râ was the prenomen or
throne-name of Thothmes IV. Tied round a pillar in the tomb is still a
length of the actual rope used by the thieves for crossing the chasm,
which, as in many of the tombs here, was left open in the gallery to bar
the way to plunderers. The mummy of the king was found in the tomb of
Amenhetep II, and is now at Cairo.
</p>
<p>
The discovery of the tomb of Thothmes I and Hat-shepsu has already been
described. In 1905 Mr. Davis made his latest find, the tomb of Iuaa
and Tuaa, the father and mother of Queen Tii, the famous consort of
Amenhetep III and mother of Akhunaten the heretic. Readers of Prof.
Maspero's history will remember that Iuaa and Tuaa are mentioned on one
of the large memorial scarabs of Amenhetep III, which commemorates his
marriage. The tomb has yielded an almost incredible treasure of funerary
furniture, besides the actual mummies of Tii's parents, including a
chariot overlaid with gold. Gold overlay of great thickness is found on
everything, boxes, chairs, etc. It was no wonder that Egypt seemed the
land of gold to the Asiatics, and that even the King of Babylon begs
this very Pharaoh Amenhetep to send him gold, in one of the letters
found at Tell el-Amarna, "for gold is as water in thy land." It is
probable that Egypt really attained the height of her material wealth
and prosperity in the reign of Amenhetep III. Certainly her dominion
reached its farthest limits in his time, and his influence was felt from
the Tigris to the Sudan. He hunted lions for his pleasure in Northern
Mesopotamia, and he built temples at Jebel Barkal beyond Dongola. We see
the evidence of lavish wealth in the furniture of the tomb of Iuaa and
Tuaa. Yet, fine as are many of these gold-overlaid and overladen objects
of the XVIIIth Dynasty, they have neither the good taste nor the charm
of the beautiful jewels from the XIIth Dynasty tombs at Dashûr. It is
mere vulgar wealth. There is too much gold thrown about. "For gold is as
water in thy land." In three hundred years' time Egypt was to know what
poverty meant, when the poor priest-kings of the XXIst Dynasty could
hardly keep body and soul together and make a comparatively decent show
as Pharaohs of Egypt. Then no doubt the latter-day Thebans sighed for
the good old times of the XVIIIth Dynasty, when their city ruled a
considerable part of Africa and Western Asia and garnered their riches
into her coffers. But the days of the XIIth Dynasty had really been
better still. Then there was not so much wealth, but what there was (and
there was as much gold then, too) was used sparingly, tastefully, and
simply. The XIIth Dynasty, not the XVIIIth, was the real Golden Age of
Egypt.
</p>
<p>
From the funeral panoply of a tomb like that of Iuaa and Tuaa we can
obtain some idea of the pomp and state of Amenhetep III. But the remains
of his Theban palace, which have been discovered and excavated by Mr. C.
Tytus and Mr. P. E. Newberry, do not bear out this idea of magnificence.
It is quite possible that the palace was merely a pleasure house,
erected very hastily and destined to fall to pieces when its owner tired
of it or died, like the many palaces of the late Khedive Ismail. It
stood on the border of an artificial lake, whereon the Pharaoh and his
consort Tii sailed to take their pleasure in golden barks. This is now
the cultivated rectangular space of land known as the Birket Habû, which
is still surrounded by the remains of the embankment built to retain its
waters, and becomes a lake during the inundation. On the western shore
of this lake Amenhetep erected the "stately pleasure dome," the
remains of which still cover the sandy tract known as el-Malkata, "the
Salt-pans," south of the great temple of Medînet Habû. These remains
consist merely of the foundations and lowest wall-courses of a
complicated and rambling building of many chambers, constructed of
common unburnt brick and plastered with white stucco on walls and
floors, on which were painted beautiful frescoes of fighting bulls,
birds of the air, water-fowl, fish-ponds, etc., in much the same style
as the frescoes of Tell el-Amarna executed in the next reign. There
were small pillared halls, the columns of which were of wood, mounted
on bases of white limestone. The majority still remain in position. In
several chambers there are small daïses, and in one the remains of a
throne, built of brick and mud covered with plaster and stucco, upon
which the Pharaoh Amenhetep sat. This is the palace of him whom the
Greeks called Memnon, who ruled Egypt when Israel was in bondage and
when the dynasty of Minos reigned in Crete. Here by the side of his
pleasure-lake the most powerful of Egyptian Pharaohs whiled away his
time during the summer heats. Evidently the building was intended to be
of the lightest construction, and never meant to last; but to our ideas
it seems odd that an Egyptian Pharaoh should live in a mud palace. Such
a building is, however, quite suited to the climate of Egypt, as are the
modern crude brick dwellings of the fellahîn. In the ruins of the
palace were found several small objects of interest, and close by was
an ancient glass manufactory of Amenhetep III's time, where much of the
characteristic beautifully coloured and variegated opaque glass of the
period was made.

<p>
The tombs of the magnates of Amenhetep III's reign and of the reigns
of his immediate predecessors were excavated, as has been said, on the
eastern slope of the hill of Shêkh 'Abd el-Kûrna, where was the earliest
Theban necropolis. No doubt many of the early tombs of the time of the
VIth Dynasty were appropriated and remodelled by the XVIIIth Dynasty
magnates. We have an instance of time's revenge in this matter, in the
case of the tomb of Imadua, a great priestly official of the time of
the XXth Dynasty. This tomb previously belonged to an XVIIIth Dynasty
worthy, but Imadua appropriated it three hundred years later and covered
up all its frescoes with the much begilt decoration fashionable in his
period. Perhaps the XVIIIth Dynasty owner had stolen it from an original
owner of the time of the VIth Dynasty. The tomb has lately been cleared
out by Mr. Newberry.
</p>
<p>
Much work of the same kind has been done here of late years by Messrs.
Newberry and R. L. Mond, in succession. To both we are indebted for the
excavation of many known tombs, as well as for the discovery of many
others previously unknown. Among the former was that of Sebekhetep,
cleared by Mr. Newberry. Se-bekhetep was an official of the time of
Thothmes III. From his tomb, and from others in the same hill, came many
years ago the fine frescoes shown in the illustration, which are among
the most valued treasures of the Egyptian department of the British
Museum. They are typical specimens of the wall-decoration of an XVIIIth
Dynasty tomb. On one may be seen a bald-headed peasant, with staff in
hand, pulling an ear of corn from the standing crop in order to see if
it is ripe. He is the "Chief Reaper," and above him is a prayer that the
"great god in heaven" may increase the crop. To the right of him is a
charioteer standing beside a car and reining back a pair of horses, one
black, the other bay. Below is another charioteer with two white
horses. He sits on the floor of the car with his back to them, eating
or resting, while they nibble the branches of a tree close by. Another
scene is that of a scribe keeping tally of offerings brought to the
tomb, while fellahm are bringing flocks of geese and other fowl, some in
crates. The inscription above is apparently addressed by the goose-herd
to the man with the crates. It reads: "Hasten thy feet because of the
geese! Hearken! thou knowest not the next minute what has been said
to thee!" Above, a reïs with a stick bids other peasants squat on the
ground before addressing the scribe, and he is saying to them: "Sit ye
down to talk." The third scene is in another style; on it may be seen
Semites bringing offerings of vases of gold, silver, and copper to the
royal presence, bowing themselves to the ground and kissing the dust
before the throne. The fidelity and accuracy with which the racial type
of the tribute-bearers is given is most extraordinary; every face
seems a portrait, and each one might be seen any day now in the Jewish
quarters of Whitechapel.

<p>
The first two paintings are representative of a very common style of
fresco-pictures in these tombs. The care with which the animals
are depicted is remarkable. Possibly one of the finest Egyptian
representations of an animal is the fresco of a goat in the tomb of
Gen-Amen, discovered by Mr. Mond. There is even an attempt here at
chiaroscuro, which is unknown to Egyptian art generally, except at Tell
el-Amarna. Evidently the Egyptian painters reached the apogee of
their art towards the end of the XVIIIth Dynasty. The third, the
representation of tribute-bearers, is of a type also well known at
this period. In all the chief tombs we have processions of Egyptians,
Westerners, Northerners, Easterners, and Southerners, bringing tribute
to the Pharaoh. The North is represented by the Semites, the East by the
Punites (when they occur), the South by negroes, the West by the Keftiu
or people of Crete and Cyprus. The representations of the last-named
people have become of the very highest interest during the last few
years, on account of the discoveries in Crete, which have revealed to
us the state and civilization of these very Keftiu. Messrs. Evans
and Halbherr have discovered at Knossos and Phaistos the cities and
palace-temples of the king who sent forth their ambassadors to far-away
Egypt with gifts for the mighty Pharaoh; these ambassadors were painted
in the tombs of their hosts as representative of the quarter of the
world from which they came.
</p>
<p>
The two chief Egyptian representations of these people, who since they
lived in Greece may be called Greeks, though their more proper title
would be "Pe-lasgians," are to be found in the tombs of Rekhmarâ and
Senmut, the former a vizier under Thothmes III, the latter the
architect of Hatshepsu's temple at Dêr el-Bahari. Senmut's tomb is a
new rediscovery. It was known, as Rekhmarâ's was, in the early days of
Egyptological science, and Prisse d'Avennes copied its paintings. It was
afterwards lost sight of until rediscovered by Mr. Newberry and Prof.
Steindorff.

</center>

<p>
The tomb of Rekhmarâ (No. 35) is well known to every visitor to Thebes,
but it is difficult to get at that of Senmut (No. 110); it lies at the
top of the hill round to the left and overlooking Dêr el-Bahari,
an appropriate place for it, by the way. In some ways Senmut's
representations are more interesting than Rekhmarâ's. They are more
easily seen, since they are now in the open air, the fore hall of the
tomb having been ruined; and they are better preserved, since they have
not been subjected to a century of inspection with naked candles and
pawing with greasy hands, as have Rekhmarâ's frescoes. Further, there
is no possibility of mistaking what they represent. From right to
left, walking in procession, we see the Minoan gift-bearers from Crete,
carrying in their hands and on their shoulders great cups of gold and
silver, in shape like the famous gold cups found at Vaphio in Lakonia,
but much larger, also a ewer of gold and silver exactly like one of
bronze discovered by Mr. Evans two years ago at Knossos, and a huge
copper jug with four ring-handles round the sides. All these vases are
specifically and definitely Mycenaean, or rather, following the new
terminology, Minoan. They are of Greek manufacture and are carried on
the shoulders of Pelasgian Greeks. The bearers wear the usual Mycenaean
costume, high boots and a gaily ornamented kilt, and little else, just
as we see it depicted in the fresco of the Cupbearer at Knossos and
in other Greek representations. The coiffure, possibly the most
characteristic thing about the Mycenaean Greeks, is faithfully
represented by the Egyptians both here and in Rekhmarâ's tomb. The
Mycenaean men allowed their hair to grow to its full natural length,
like women, and wore it partly hanging down the back, partly tied up
in a knot or plait (the <i>kepas</i> of the dandy Paris in the Iliad) on the
crown of the head. This was the universal fashion, and the Keftiu are
consistently depicted by the XVIIIth Dynasty Egyptians as following it.
The faces in the Senmut fresco are not so well portrayed as those in the
Rekhmarâ fresco. There it is evident that the first three ambassadors
are faithfully depicted, as the portraits are marked. The procession
advances from left to right. The first man, "the Great Chief of the
Kefti and the Isles of the Green Sea," is young, and has a remarkably
small mouth with an amiable expression. His complexion is fair rather
than dark, but his hair is dark brown. His lieutenant, the next in
order, is of a different type,&mdash;elderly, with a most forbidding visage,
Roman nose, and nutcracker jaws. Most of the others are very much
alike,&mdash;young, dark in complexion, and with long black hair hanging
below their waists and twisted up into fantastic knots and curls on the
tops of their heads. One, carrying on his shoulder a great silver vase
with curving handles and in one hand a dagger of early European Bronze
Age type, is looking back to hear some remark of his next companion.
Any one of these gift-bearers might have sat for the portrait of
the Knossian Cupbearer, the fresco discovered by Mr. Evans in the
palace-temple of Minos; he has the same ruddy brown complexion, the same
long black hair dressed in the same fashion, the same parti-coloured
kilt, and he bears his vase in much the same way. We have only to allow
for the difference of Egyptian and Mycenaean ways of drawing. There is
no doubt whatever that these Keftiu of the Egyptians were Cretans of the
Minoan Age. They used to be considered Phoenicians, but this view was
long ago exploded. They are not Semites, and that is quite enough.
Neither are they Asiatics of any kind. They are purely and simply
Mycenaean, or rather Minoan, Greeks of the pre-Hellenic period&mdash;Pelasgi,
that is to say.
</p>
<p>
Probably no discovery of more far-reaching importance to our knowledge
of the history of the world generally and of our own culture especially
has ever been made than the finding of Mycenæ by Schliemann, and
the further finds that have resulted therefrom, culminating in the
discoveries of Mr. Arthur Evans at Knossos. Naturally, these discoveries
are of extraordinary interest to us, for they have revealed the
beginnings and first bloom of the European civilization of to-day. For
our culture-ancestors are neither the Egyptians, nor the Assyrians, nor
the Hebrews, but the Hellenes, and they, the Aryan-Greeks, derived most
of their civilization from the pre-Hellenic people whom they found in
the land before them, the Pelasgi or "Mycenæan" Greeks, "Minoans," as we
now call them, the Keftiu of the Egyptians. These are the ancient Greeks
of the Heroic Age, to which the legends of the Hellenes refer; in their
day were fought the wars of Troy and of the Seven against Thebes, in
their day the tragedy of the Atridse was played out to its end, in their
day the wise Minos ruled Knossos and the <i>Ægean</i>. And of all the events
which are at the back of these legends we know nothing. The hiéroglyphed
tablets of the pre-Hellenic Greeks lie before us, but we cannot read
them; we can only see that the Minoan writing in many ways resembled
the Egyptian, thus again confirming our impression of the original early
connection of the two cultures.
</p>
<p>
In view of this connection, and the known close relations between Crete
and Egypt, from the end of the XIIth Dynasty to the end of the XVIIIth,
we might have hoped to recover at Knossos a bilingual inscription in
Cretan and Egyptian hieroglyphs which would give us the key to the
Minoan script and tell us what we so dearly wish to know. But this hope
has not yet been realized. Two Egyptian inscriptions have been found at
Knossos, but no bilingual one. A list of Keftian names is preserved in
the British Museum upon an Egyptian writing-board from Thebes with what
is perhaps a copy of a single Cretan hieroglyph, a vase; but again,
nothing bilingual. A list of "Keftian words" occurs at the head of a
papyrus, also in the British Museum, but they appear to be nonsense,
a mere imitation of the sounds of a strange tongue. Still we need
not despair of finding the much desired Cretan-Egyptian bilingual
inscription yet. Perhaps the double text of a treaty between Crete and
Egypt, like that of Ramses II with the Hittites, may come to light.
Meanwhile we can only do our best with the means at our hand to trace
out the history of the relations of the oldest European culture with
the ancient civilization of Egypt. The tomb-paintings at Thebes are very
important material. Eor it is due to them that the voice of the doubter
has finally ceased to be heard, and that now no archaeologist questions
that the Egyptians were in direct communication with the Cretan
Mycenæans in the time of the XVIIIth Dynasty, some fifteen hundred years
before Christ, for no one doubts that the pictures of the Keftiu are
pictures of Mycenaeans.
</p>
<p>
As we have seen, we know that this connection was far older than the
time of the XVIIIth Dynasty, but it is during that time and the Hyksos
period that we have the clearest documentary proof of its existence,
from the statuette of Abnub and the alabastron lid of King Khian,
found at Knossos, down to the Mycenaean pottery fragments found at Tell
el-Amarna, a site which has been utterly abandoned since the time of
the heretic Akhunaten (B.C. 1430), so that there is no possibility of
anything found there being later than his time. That the connection
existed as late as the time of the XXth Dynasty we know from the
representations of golden <i>Bügelkannen</i> or false-necked vases of
Mycenaean form in the tomb of Ramses III in the Bibân el-Mulûk, and of
golden cups of Vaphio type in the tomb of Imadua, already mentioned.
This brings the connection down to about 1050 B.C.
</p>
<p>
After that date we cannot hope to find any certain evidence of
connection, for by that time the Mycenaean civilization had probably
come to an end. In the days of the XIIth and XVIIIth Dynasties a great
and splendid power evidently existed in Crete, and sent its peaceful
ambassadors, the Keftiu who are represented in the Theban tombs, to
Egypt. But with the XIXth Dynasty the name of the Keftiu disappears from
Egyptian records, and their place is taken by a congeries of warring
seafaring tribes, whose names as given by the Egyptians seem to be forms
of tribal and place names well known to us in the Greece of later days.
We find the Akaivasha (<i>Axaifol</i>, Achaians), Shakalsha (Sagalassians of
Pisidia), Tursha (Tylissians of Crete?), and Shardana (Sardians) allied
with the Libyans and Mashauash (Maxyes) in a land attack upon Egypt in
the days of Meneptah, the successor of Ramses II&mdash;just as in the later
days of the XXVIth Dynasty the Northern pirates visited the African
shore of the Mediterranean, and in alliance with the predatory Libyans
attacked Egypt.
</p>
<p>
Prof. Petrie has lately [History of Egypt, iii, pp. Ill, I12.] proffered
an alternative view, which would make all these tribes Tunisians and
Algerians, thus disposing of the identification of the Akaivasha with
the Achaians, and making them the ancient representatives of the town
of el-Aghwat (Roman Agbia) in Tunis. But several difficulties might be
pointed out which are in the way of an acceptance of this view, and it
is probable that the older identifications with Greek tribes must still
be retained, so that Meneptah's Akaivasha are evidently the ancient
representatives of the Achai(v)ans, the Achivi of the Roman poets. The
terminations <i>sha</i> and <i>na</i>, which appear in these names, are merely
ethnic and locative affixes belonging to the Asianic language system
spoken by these tribes at that time, to which the language of the Minoan
Cretans (which is written in the Knossian hieroglyphs) belonged. They
existed in ancient Lycian in the forms <i>azzi</i> and <i>nna</i>, and we find
them enshrined in the Asia Minor place-names terminating in <i>assos</i>
and <i>nda</i>, as Halikarnassos, Sagalassos (Shakalasha in Meneptah's
inscription), Oroanda, and Labraunda (which, as we have seen, is the
same as the [Greek word], a word of pre-Hellenic origin, both meaning
"Place of the Double Axe") The identification of these <i>sha</i> and <i>nal</i>
terminations in the Egyptian transliterations of the foreign names, with
the Lycian affixes referred to, was made some five years ago,* and is
now generally accepted. We have, then, to find the equivalents of
these names, to strike off the final termination, as in the case of
Akaiva-sha, where Akaiva only is the real name, and this seems to be
the Egyptian equivalent of <i>Axaifol</i>, Achivi. It is strange to meet with
this great name on an Egyptian monument of the thirteenth century B.C.
But yet not so strange, when we recollect that it is precisely to that
period that Greek legend refers the war of Troy, which was an attack
by Greek tribes from all parts of the Ægean upon the Asianic city
at Hissarlik in the Troad, exactly parallel to the attacks of the
Northerners on Egypt. And Homer preserves many a reminiscence of early
Greek visits, peaceful and the reverse, to the coast of Egypt at this
period. The reader will have noticed that one no longer treats the siege
of Troy as a myth. To do so would be to exhibit a most uncritical mind;
even the legends of King Arthur have a historic foundation, and those of
the Nibelungen are still more probable.

In the eighth year of Ramses III the second Northern attack was made,
by the Pulesta (<i>Pelishtim</i>, Philistines), Tjakaray, Shakalasha
(Sagalassians), Vashasha, and Danauna or Daanau, in alliance with North
Syrian tribes. The Danauna are evidently the ancient representatives of
the <i>Aavaoî</i>, the Danaans who formed the bulk of the Greek army against
Troy under the leadership of the long-haired Achaians, [Greek words]
(like the Keftiu). The Vashasha have been identified by the writer with
the Axians, the [Greek word] of Crete. Prof. Petrie compares the name
of the Tjakaray with that of the (modern) place Zakro in Crete.
Identifications with modern place-names are of doubtful value;
for instance, we cannot but hold that Prof. Petrie errs greatly in
identifying the name of the Pidasa (another tribe mentioned in Ramses
II's time) with that of the river Pidias in Cyprus. "Pidias" is a purely
modern corruption of the ancient Pediseus, which means the "plain-river"
(because it flows through the central plain of the island), from the
Greek [Greek word]. If, then, we make the Pidasa Cypriotes we assume
that pure Greek was spoken in Cyprus as early as 1100 b. c, which is
highly improbable. The Pidasa were probably Le-leges (Pedasians); the
name of Pisidia may be the same, by metathesis. Pedasos is a name always
connected with the much wandering tribe of the Leleges, where-ever they
are found in Lakonia or in Asia Minor. We believe them to have been
known to the Egyptians as Pidasa. The identification of the Tjakaray
with Zakro is very tempting. The name was formerly identified with
that of the Teukrians, but the v in the word Tewpot lias always been a
stumbling-block in the way. Perhaps Zakro is neither more nor less than
the Tetkpoc-name, since the legendary Teucer, the archer, was connected
with the eastern or Eteokretan end of Crete, where Zakro lies. In
Mycenæan times Zakro was an important place, so that the Tjakaray may
be the Teukroi, after all, and Zakro may preserve the name. At any rate,
this identification is most alluring and, taken in conjunction with
the other cumulative identifications, is very probable; but the
identification of the Pidæa with the river Pediæus in Cyprus is
neither alluring nor probable.
</p>
<p>
In the time of Ramses II some of these Asia Minor tribes had marched
against Egypt as allies of the Hittites. We find among them the Luka or
Lycians, the Dardenui (Dardanians, who may possibly have been at that
time in the Troad, or elsewhere, for all these tribes were certainly
migratory), and the Masa (perhaps the Mysians). With the Cretans of
Ramses Ill's time must be reckoned the Pulesta, who are certainly the
Philistines, then most probably in course of their traditional migration
from Crete to Palestine. In Philistia recent excavations by Mr. Welch
have disclosed the unmistakable presence of a late Mycenæan culture,
and we can only ascribe this to the Philistines, who were of Cretan
origin.
</p>
<p>
Thus we see that all these Northern tribal names hold together with
remarkable persistence, and in fact refuse to be identified with any
tribes but those of Asia Minor and the Ægean. In them we see the broken
remnants of the old Minoan (Keftian) power, driven hither and thither
across the seas by intestinal feuds, and "winding the skein of grievous
wars till every man of them perished," as Homer says of the heroes after
the siege of Troy. These were in fact the wanderings of the heroes, the
period of <i>Sturm und Drang</i> which succeeded the great civilized epoch of
Minos and his thalassocracy, of Knossos, Phaistos, and the Keftius.
On the walls of the temple of Medînet Habû, Ramses III depicted the
portraits of the conquered heroes who had fallen before the Egyptian
onslaught, and he called them heroes, <i>tuher</i> in Egyptian, fully
recognizing their Berserker gallantry. Above all in interest are the
portraits of the Philistines, those Greeks who at this very time seized
part of Palestine (which takes its name from them), and continued to
exist there as a separate people (like the Normans in France) for at
least two centuries. Goliath the giant was, then, a Greek; certainly he
was of Cretan descent, and so a Pelasgian.
</p>
<p>
Such are the conclusions to which modern discovery in Crete has impelled
us with regard to the pictures of the Keftiu at Shêkh 'Abd el-Kûrna. It
is indeed a new chapter in the history of the relations of ancient Egypt
with the outside world that Dr. Arthur Evans has opened for us. And in
this connection some American work must not be overlooked. An expedition
sent out by the University of Pennsylvania, under Miss Harriet Boyd,
has discovered much of importance to Mycenæan study in the ruins of an
ancient town at Gournia in Crete, east of Knossos. Here, however, little
has been found that will bear directly on the question of relations
between Mycenaean Greece and Egypt.
</p>
<p>
The Theban nécropoles of the New Empire are by no means exhausted by a
description of the Tombs of the Kings and Shêkh 'Abd el-Kûrna; but few
new discoveries have been made anywhere except in the picturesque valley
of the Tombs of the Queens, south of Shêkh 'Abd el-Kûrna. Here the
Italian Egyptologist, Prof. Schiaparelli, has lately discovered and
excavated some very fine tombs of the XIXth and XXth Dynasties. The best
is that of Queen Nefertari, one of the wives of Ramses II. The colouring
of the reliefs upon these walls is extraordinarily bright, and the
portraits of the queen, who has a very beautiful face, with aquiline
nose, are wonderfully preserved. She was of the dark type, while another
queen, Titi by name, who was buried close by, was fair, and had a
retroussé nose. Prof. Schiaparelli also discovered here the tombs of
some princes of the XXth Dynasty, who died young. All the tombs are
much alike, with a single short gallery, on the walls of which are
mythological scenes, figures of the prince and of his father, the king,
etc., painted in a crude style, which shows a great degeneration from
that of the XVIIIth Dynasty tombs.
</p>
<p>
We now leave the great necropolis and turn to the later temples of the
Western Bank at Thebes. These were of a funerary character, like those
of Dêr el-Bahari, already described. The most imposing of all in some
respects is the Ramesseum, where lies the huge granite colossus of
Ramses II, prostrate and broken, which Diodorus knew as the statue of
Osymandyas. This name is a late corruption of Ramses II's throne-name,
User-maat-Rà, pronounced Ûsimare. The temple has been cleared by
Mr. Howard Carter for the Egyptian government, and the small town of
priests' houses, magazines, and cellars, to the west of it, has been
excavated by him. This is quite a little Pompeii, with its small
streets, its houses with the stucco still clinging to the walls, its
public altar, its market colonnade, and its gallery of statues. The
statues are only of brick like the walls, and roughly shaped and
plastered, but they were portraits, undoubtedly, of celebrities of
the time, though we do not know of whom. On either side are the long
magazines in which were kept the possessions of the priests of the
Ramesseum, the grain from the lands with which they were endowed, and
everything meet to be offered to the ghost of the king whom they served.
The plan of the place had evidently been altered after the time of
Ramses II, as remains of overbuilding were found here and there. The
magazines were first investigated in 1896 by Prof. Petrie, who also
found in the neighbourhood the remains of a number of small royal
funerary temples of the XVIIIth Dynasty, all looking in the direction of
the hill, beyond which lay the tombs of the kings.

We may now turn to Luxor, where immediately above the landing-place of
the steamers and dahabiyas rise the stately coloured colonnades of the
Temple of Luxor. Unfortunately, modern excavations have not been
allowed to pursue their course to completion here, as in the first great
colonnaded court, which was added by Ramses II to the original building
of Amenhetep III, Tutankhamen, and Horemheb, there still remains
the Mohammedan Mosque of Abu-'l-Haggâg, which may not be removed.
Abu-'l-Haggâg, "the Father of Pilgrims" (so called on account of the
number of pilgrims to his shrine), was a very holy shêkh, and his memory
is held in the greatest reverence by the Luksuris. It is unlucky that
this mosque was built within the court of the Great Temple, and it
cannot be removed till Moslem religious prejudices become at least
partially ameliorated, and then the work of completely excavating the
Temple of Luxor may be carried out.
</p>
<p>
Between Luxor and Karnak lay the temple of the goddess Mut, consort of
Amen and protectress of Thebes. It stood in the part of the city known
as Asheru. This building was cleared in 1895 at the expense and under
the supervision of two English ladies, Miss Benson and Miss Gourlay.

The temple had always been remarkable on account of the prodigious
number of seated figures of the lioness-headed goddess Sekhemet, or
Pakhet, which it contains, dedicated by Amenhetep III and Sheshenk I;
most of those in the British Museum were brought from this temple.
The excavators found many more of them, and also some very interesting
portrait-statues of the late period which had been dedicated there.
The most important of these was the head and shoulders of a statue of
Mentuemhat, governor of Thebes at the time of the sack of the city by
Ashur-bani-pal of Assyria in 668 B.C. In Miss Benson's interesting book,
<i>The Temple of Mut in Asher</i>, it is suggested, on the authority of Prof.
Petrie, that his facial type is Cypriote, but this speculation is a
dangerous one, as is also the similar speculation that the wonderful
portrait-head of an old man found by Miss Benson [* Plate vii of her
book.] is of Philistine type. We have only to look at the faces of
elderly Egyptians to-day to see that the types presented by Mentuemhat
and Miss Benson's "Philistine" need be nothing but pure Egyptian. The
whole work of the clearing was most efficiently carried out, and the
Cairo Museum obtained from it some valuable specimens of Egyptian
sculpture.
</p>
<p>
The Great Temple of Karnak is one of the chief cares of the Egyptian
Department of Antiquities. Its paramount importance, so to speak, as the
cathedral temple of Egypt, renders its preservation and exploration a
work of constant necessity, and its great extent makes this work one
which is always going on and which probably will be going on for many
years to come. The Temple of Karnak has cost the Egyptian government
much money, yet not a piastre of this can be grudged. For several years
past the works have been under the charge of M. Georges Legrain, the
well-known engineer and draughtsman who was associated with M. de
Morgan in the work at Dashûr. His task is to clear out the whole temple
thoroughly, to discover in it what previous investigators have left
undiscovered, and to restore to its original position what has fallen.

     The left-hand obelisk is the highest in Egypt, and was
     erected by Hatshepsu; the right-hand obelisk was put up by
     Thothmes III. No general work of restoration is
     contemplated, nor would this be in the slightest degree
     desirable. Up to the present M. Legrain has certainly
     carried out all three branches of his task with great
     success. An unforeseen event has, however, considerably
     complicated and retarded the work.
</pre>
<p>
In October, 1899, one of the columns of the side aisles of the great
Hypostyle Hall fell, bringing down with it several others. The whole
place was a chaotic ruin, and for a moment it seemed as though the whole
of the Great Hall, one of the wonders of the world, would collapse.
The disaster was due to the gradual infiltration of water from the Nile
beneath the structure, whose foundations, as is usual in Egypt, were of
the flimsiest description. Even the most imposing Egyptian temples
have jerry-built foundations; usually they are built on the top of the
wall-stumps of earlier buildings of different plan, filled in with a
confused mass of earlier slabs and weak rubbish of all kinds. Had the
Egyptian buildings been built on sure foundations, they would have been
preserved to a much greater extent even than they are. In such a climate
as that of Egypt a stone building well built should last for ever.
</p>
<p>
M. Legrain has for the last five years been busy repairing the damage.
All the fallen columns are now restored to the perpendicular, and the
capitals and architraves are in process of being hoisted into their
original positions. The process by which M. Legrain carries out this
work has been already described. He works in the old Egyptian fashion,
building great inclines or ramps of earth up which the pillar-drums,
the capitals, and the architrave-blocks are hauled by manual labour, and
then swung into position. This is the way in which the Egyptians built
Karnak, and in this way, too, M. Le-grain is rebuilding it. It is a slow
process, but a sure one, and now it will not be long before we shall
see the hall, except its roof, in much the same condition as it was when
Seti built it. Lovers of the picturesque will, however, miss the famous
leaning column, hanging poised across the hall, which has been a main
feature in so many pictures and photographs of Karnak. This fell in the
catastrophe of 1899, and naturally it has not been possible to restore
it to its picturesque, but dangerous, position.
</p>
<p>
The work at Karnak has been distinguished during the last two years by
two remarkable discoveries. Outside the main temple, to the north of
the Hypostyle Hall, M. Legrain found a series of private sanctuaries or
shrines, built of brick by personages of the XVIIIth Dynasty and later,
in order to testify their devotion to Amen. In these small cells were
found some remarkable statues, one of which is illustrated. It is one of
the most perfect of its kind. A great dignitary of the XVIIIth Dynasty
is seen seated with his wife, their daughter standing between them.
Round his neck are four chains of golden rings, with which he had been
decorated by the Pharaoh for his services. It is a remarkable group,
interesting for its style and workmanship as well as for its subject. As
an example of the formal hieratic type of portraiture it is very fine.
</p>
<p>
The other and more important discovery of the two was made by M. Legrain
on the south side of the Hypo-style Hall.

</p>
<p>
M. de Morgan in the work at Dashûr. His task is to clear out the whole
temple thoroughly, to discover in it what previous investigators have
left undiscovered, and to restore to its original position what has
fallen. Tentative excavations, begun in an unoccupied tract under the
wall of the hall, resulted in the discovery of parts of statues; the
place was then regularly excavated, and the result has been amazing.
The ground was full of statues, large and small, at some unknown period
buried pell-mell, one on the top of another. Some are broken, but the
majority are perfect, which is in itself unusual, and is due very much
to the soft, muddy soil in which they have lain. Statues found on dry
desert land are often terribly cracked, especially when they are of
black granite, the crystals of which seem to have a greater tendency to
disintegration than have those of the red syenite. The Karnak statues
are figures of pious persons, who had dedicated portraits of themselves
in the temple of Amen, together with those of great men whom the king
had honoured by ordering their statues placed in the temple during their
lives.
</p>
<p>
Of this number was the great sage Amenhetep, son of Hapi, the founder of
the little desert temple of Dêr el-Medîna, near Dêr el-Bahari, who was
a sort of prime minister under Amenhetep III, and was venerated in later
days as a demigod. His statue was found with the others by M. Legrain.
Among them is a figure made entirely of green felspar, an unusual
material for so large a statuette. A fine portrait of Thothmes III was
also found. The illustration shows this wonderfully fruitful excavation
in progress, with the diggers at work in the black mud soil, in the
foreground the basket-boys carrying away the rubbish on their shoulders,
and the massive granite walls of the Great Hypostyle Hall of Seti in the
background. The huge size of the roof-blocks is noticeable. These are
not the actual uppermost roof-blocks, but only the architraves from
pillar to pillar; the original roof consisted of similar blocks laid
across in the transverse direction from architrave to architrave. An
Egyptian granite temple was in fact built upon the plan of a child's box
of bricks; it was but a modified and beautified Stonehenge.

<p>
Among them are statues of the late Middle Kingdom, including one of King
Usertsen (Senusret) IV of the XIIIth Dynasty. There are also reliefs of
the reign of Amenhetep I, which are remarkable for the delicacy of their
workmanship and the sureness of their technique.
</p>
<p>
We know that the temple was built as early as the time of TJsertsen,
for in it have been found one or two of his blocks; and no doubt the
original shrine, which was rebuilt in the time of Philip Arrhidseus, was
of the same period, but hitherto no remains of the centuries between his
time and that of Hatshepsu had been found. With M. Legrain's work in the
greatest temple of Thebes we finish our account of the new discoveries
in the chief city of ancient Egypt, as we began it with the work of M.
Naville in the oldest temple there.
</p>
<p>
One of the most interesting questions connected with the archaeology
of Thebes is that which asks whether the heretical disk-worshipper
Akhunaten (Amenhetep IV) erected buildings there, and whether any
trace of them has ever been discovered. To those who are interested in
Egyptian history and religion the transitory episode of the disk-worship
heresy is already familiar. The precise character of the heretical
dogma, which Amenhetep IV proclaimed and desired his subjects to.
accept, has lately been well explained by Mr. de Garis Davies in his
volumes, published by the "Archaeological Survey of Egypt" branch of
the Egypt Exploration Fund, on the tombs of el-Amarna. He shows that the
heretical doctrine was a monotheism of a very high order. Amenhetep IV
(or as he preferred to call himself, Akhunaten, "Glory of the Disk") did
not, as has usually been supposed, merely worship the Sun-disk itself
as the giver of life, and nothing more. He venerated the glowing disk
merely as the visible emanation of the deity behind it, who dispensed
heat and life to all living things through its medium. The disk was, so
to speak, the window in heaven through which the unknown God, the "Lord
of the Disk," shed a portion of his radiance on the world. Now, given
an ignorance of the true astronomical character of the sun, we see how
eminently rational a religion this was. In effect, the sun is the source
of all life upon this earth, and so Akhunaten caused its rays to be
depicted each with a hand holding out the sign of life to the earth. The
monotheistic worship of the sun alone is certainly the highest form of
pagan religion, but Akhunaten saw further than this. His doctrine was
that there was a deity behind the sun, whose glory shone through it and
gave us life. This deity was unnamed and unnamable; he was "the Lord
of the Disk." We see in his heresy, therefore, the highest attitude
to which religious ideas had attained before the days of the Hebrew
prophets.
</p>
<p>
This religion seems to have been developed out of the philosophical
speculations of the priests of the Sun at Heliopolis. Akhunaten with
unwise iconoclastic zeal endeavoured to root out the worship of the
ancient gods of Egypt, and especially that of Amen-Bà, the ruler of the
Egyptian pantheon, whose primacy in the hearts of the people made him
the most redoubtable rival of the new doctrine. But the name of the
old Sun-god Bà-Harmaehis was spared, and it is evident that Akhunaten
regarded him as more or less identical with his god.
</p>
<p>
It has been supposed by Prof. Petrie that Queen Tii, the mother of
Akhunaten, was of Mitannian (Armenian) origin, and that she brought the
Aten religion to Egypt from her native land, and taught it to her son.
Certainly it seems as though the new doctrine had made some headway
before the death of Amenhetep III, but we have no reason to attribute it
to Tii, or to suppose that she brought it with her from abroad. There is
no proof whatever that she was not a native Egyptian, and the mummies of
her parents, Iuaa and Tuaa, are purely Egyptian in facial type. It
seems undoubted that the Aten cult was a development of pure Egyptian
religious thought.
</p>
<p>
At first Akhunaten tried to establish his religion at Thebes alongside
that of Amen and his attendant pantheon. He seems to have built a temple
to the Aten there, and we see that his courtiers began to make tombs for
themselves in the new realistic style of sculptural art, which the king,
heretical in art as in religion, had introduced. The tomb of Barnes at
Shêkh 'Abd el-Kûrna has on one side of the door a representation of
the king in the old regular style, and on the other side one in the new
realistic style, which depicts him in all the native ugliness in which
this strange truth-loving man seems to have positively gloried. We
find, too, that he caused a temple to the Aten to be erected in far-away
Napata, the capital of Nubia, by Jebel Barkal in the Sudan. The facts
as to the Theban and Napata temples have been pointed out by Prof.
Breasted, of Chicago.
</p>
<p>
But the opposition of the Theban priesthood was too strong. Akhunaten
shook the dust of the capital off his feet and retired to the isolated
city of Akhet-aten, "the Glory of the Disk," at the modern Tell
el-Amarna, where he could philosophize in peace, while his kingdom was
left to take care of itself. He and his wife Nefret-iti, who seems to
have been a faithful sharer of his views, reigned over a select court
of Aten-worship-ping nobles, priests, and artists. The artists had under
Akhunaten an unrivalled opportunity for development, of which they had
already begun to take considerable advantage before the end of his reign
and the restoration of the old order of ideas. Their style takes on
itself an almost bizarre freedom, which reminds us strongly of the
similar characteristic in Mycenaean art. There is a strange little
relief in the Berlin Museum of the king standing cross-legged, leaning
on a staff, and languidly smelling a flower, while the queen stands
by with her garments blown about by the wind. The artistic monarch's
graceful attitude is probably a faithful transcript of a characteristic
pose.
</p>
<p>
We see from this what an Egyptian artist could do when his shackles were
removed, but unluckily Egypt never produced another king who was at the
same time an original genius, an artist, and a thinker. When Akhunaten
died, the Egyptian artists' shackles were riveted tighter than ever.
The reaction was strong. The kingdom had fallen into anarchy, and the
foreign empire which his predecessors had built up had practically
been thrown to the winds by Akhunaten. The whole is an example of the
confusion and disorganization which ensue when a philosopher rules. Not
long after the heretic's death the old religion was fully restored, the
cult of the disk was blotted out, and the Egyptians returned joyfully
to the worship of their myriad deities. Akhunaten's ideals were too high
for them. The débris of the foreign empire was, as usual in such
cases, put together again, and customary law and order restored by
the conservative reactionaries who succeeded him. Henceforth Egyptian
civilization runs an uninspired and undeveloping course till the days
of the Saïtes and the Ptolemies. This point in the history of Egypt,
therefore, forms a convenient stopping-place at which to pause, while
we turn once more to Western Asia, and ascertain to what extent recent
excavations and research have thrown new light upon the problems
connected with the rise and history of the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian
Empires.

<h2>
    CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE ASSYRIAN AND NEO-BABYLONIAN EMPIRES IN THE LIGHT OF
</h2>
<center>
RECENT RESEARCH
</center>
<p>
The early history of Assyria has long been a subject on which historians
were obliged to trust largely to conjecture, in their attempts to
reconstruct the stages by which its early rulers obtained their
independence and laid the foundations of the mighty empire over which
their successors ruled. That the land was colonized from Babylonia and
was at first ruled as a dependency of the southern kingdom have long
been regarded as established facts, but until recently little was known
of its early rulers and governors, and still less of the condition of
the country and its capital during the early periods of their existence.
Since the excavations carried out by the British Museum at Kala
Sherghat, on the western bank of the Tigris, it has been known that
the mounds at that spot mark the site of the city of Ashur, the first
capital of the Assyrians, and the monuments and records recovered
during those excavations have hitherto formed our principal source of
information for the early history of the country.* Some of the oldest
records found in the course of these excavations were short votive texts
inscribed by rulers who bore the title of <i>ishshakku</i>, corresponding to
the Sumerian and early Babylonian title of patesi, and with some such
meaning as "viceroy." It was rightly conjectured from the title which
they bore that these early rulers owed allegiance to the kings of
Babylon and were their nominees, or at any rate their tributaries. The
names of a few of these early viceroys were recovered from their votive
inscriptions and from notices in later historical texts, but it was
obvious that our knowledge of early Assyrian history would remain very
fragmentary until systematic excavations in Assyria were resumed. Three
years ago (1902) the British Museum resumed excavations at Kuyunjik, the
site of Nineveh. The work was begun and carried out under the direction
of Mr. L. W. King, but since last summer has been continued by Mr. R. C.
Thompson. Last year, too, excavations were reopened at Sherghat by
the Deutsch-Orient Ge-sellschaft, at first under the direction of Dr.
Koldewey, and afterwards under that of Dr. Andrae, by whom they are
at present being carried on. This renewed activity on the sites of the
ancient cities of Assyria is already producing results of considerable
interest, and the veil which has so long concealed the earlier periods
in the history of that country is being lifted.
</p>
<pre>
     * For the texts and translations of these documents, see
     Budge and King, Annals of the Kings of Assyria, pp. iff.
</pre>
<p>
Shortly before these excavations in Assyria were set on foot an
indication was obtained from an early Babylonian text that the history
of Assyria as a dependent state or province of Babylon must be pushed
back to a far more remote period than had hitherto been supposed. In one
of Hammurabi's letters to Sin-idinnam, governor of the city of Larsam,
to which reference has already been made, directions are given for
the despatch to the king of "two hundred and forty men of 'the King's
Company' under the command of Nannar-iddina... who have left the country
of Ashur and the district of Shitullum." From this most interesting
reference it followed that the country to the north of Babylonia was
known as Assyria at the time of the kings of the First Dynasty of
Babylon, and the fact that Babylonian troops were stationed there
by Hammurabi proved that the country formed an integral part of the
Babylonian empire.
</p>
<p>
These conclusions were soon after strikingly confirmed by two passages
in the introductory sections of Hammurabi's code of laws which was
discovered at Susa. Here Hammurabi records that he "restored his (i.e.
the god Ashur's) protecting image unto the city of Ashur," and a few
lines farther on he describes himself as the king "who hath made
the names of Ishtar glorious in the city of Nineveh in the temple of
E-mish-mish." That Ashur should be referred to at this period is what we
might expect, inasmuch as it was known to have been the earliest capital
of Assyria; more striking is the reference to Nineveh, proving as it
does that it was a flourishing city in Hammurabi's time and that the
temple of Ishtar there had already been long established. It is true
that Gudea, the Sumerian patesi of Shirpurla, records that he rebuilt
the temple of the goddess Ninni (Ishtar) at a place called Nina. Now
Nina may very probably be identified with Nineveh, but many writers have
taken it to be a place in Southern Babylonia and possibly a district of
Shirpurla itself. No such uncertainty attaches to Hammurabi's reference
to Nineveh, which is undoubtedly the Assyrian city of that name.
Although no account has yet been published of the recent excavations
carried out at Nineveh by the British Museum, they fully corroborate the
inference drawn with regard to the great age of the city. The series of
trenches which were cut deep into the lower strata of Kuyunjik revealed
numerous traces of very early habitations on the mound.
</p>
<p>
Neither in Hammurabi's letters, nor upon the stele inscribed with his
code of laws, is any reference made to the contemporary governor or
ruler of Assyria, but on a contract tablet preserved in the Pennsylvania
Museum a name has been recovered which will probably be identified
with that of the ruler of Assyria in Hammurabi's reign. In legal and
commercial documents of the period of the First Dynasty of Babylon the
contracting parties frequently swore by the names of two gods (usually
Shamash and Marduk) and also that of the reigning king. Now it has been
found by Dr. Banke that on this document in the Pennsylvania Museum the
contracting parties swear by the name of Hammurabi and also by that of
Shamshi-Adad. As only gods and kings are mentioned in the oath formulas
of this period, it follows that Shamshi-Adad was a king, or at any rate
a patesi or ishshakku. Now from its form the name Shamshi-Adad must
be that of an Assyrian, not that of a Babylonian, and, since he is
associated in the oath formula with Hammurabi, it is legitimate to
conclude that he governed Assyria in the time of Hammurabi as a
dependency of Babylon. An early Assyrian ishshakku of this name, who was
the son of Ishme-Dagan, is mentioned by Tiglath-Pileser I, but he cannot
be identified with the ruler of the time of Hammurabi, since,
according to Tiglath-Pileser, he ruled too late, about 1800 B.C.
A brick-inscription of another Shamshi-Adad, however, the son of
Igur-kapkapu, is preserved in the British Museum, and it is probable
that we may identify him with Hammurabi's Assyrian viceroy. Erishum and
his son Ikunum, whose inscriptions are also preserved in the British
Museum, should certainly be assigned to an early period of Assyrian
history.
</p>
<p>
The recent excavations at Sherghat are already yielding the names
of other early Assyrian viceroys, and, although the texts of the
inscriptions in which their names occur have not yet been published, we
may briefly enumerate the more important of the discoveries that have
been made. Last year a small cone or cylinder was found which, though
it bears only a few lines of inscription, restores the names of no less
than seven early Assyrian viceroys whose existence was not previously
known. The cone was inscribed by Ashir-rîm-nishêshu, who gives his own
genealogy and records the restoration of the wall of the city of Ashur,
which he states had been rebuilt by certain of his predecessors on
the throne. The principal portion of the inscription reads as
follows: "Ashir-rîm-nishêshu, the viceroy of the god Ashir, the son of
Ashir-nirari, the viceroy of the god Ashir, the son of Ashir-rabi, the
viceroy. The city wall which Kikia, Ikunum, Shar-kenkate-Ashir, and
Ashir-nirari, the son of Ishme-Dagan, my forefathers, had built, was
fallen, and for the preservation of my life... I rebuilt it." Perhaps no
inscription has yet been recovered in either Assyria or Babylonia which
contained so much new information packed into so small a space. Of the
names of the early viceroys mentioned in it only one was previously
known, i.e. the name of Ikunum, the son of Erishum, is found in a late
copy of a votive text preserved in the British Museum. Thus from these
few lines the names of three rulers in direct succession have been
recovered, viz., Ashir-rabi, Ashir-nirari, and Ashur-rîm-nishêshu, and
also those of four earlier rulers, viz., Kikia, Shar-kenkate-Ashir,
Ishme-Dagan, and his son Ashir-nirari. Another interesting point about
the inscription is the spelling of the name of the national god of the
Assyrians. In the later periods it is always written <i>Ashur</i>, but at
this early time we see that the second vowel is changed and that at
first the name was written <i>Ashir</i>, a form that was already known
from the Cappadocian cuneiform inscriptions. The form Ashir is a good
participial construction and signifies "the Beneficent," "the Merciful
One."
</p>
<p>
Another interesting find, which was also made last year, consists of
four stone tablets, each engraved with the same building-inscription
of Shalmaneser I, a king who reigned over Assyria about 1300 B.C. In
recording his rebuilding of E-kharsag-kurkura, the temple of the god
Ashur in the city of Ashur, he gives a brief summary of the temple's
history with details as to the length of time which elapsed between
the different periods during which it had been previously restored. The
temple was burned in Shalmaneser's time, and, when recording this fact
and the putting out of the fire, he summarizes the temple's history in a
long parenthesis, as will be seen from the following translation of the
extract: "When E-kharsag-kurkura, the temple of Ashur, my lord, which
Ushpia (variant <i>Aushpia</i>), the priest of Ashur, my forefather, had
built aforetime,&mdash;and it fell into decay and Erishu, my forefather,
the priest of Ashur, rebuilt it; 159 years passed by after the reign of
Erishu, and that temple fell into decay, and Shamshi-Adad, the priest
of Ashur, rebuilt it; (during) 580 years that temple which Shamshi-Adad,
the priest of Ashur, had built, grew hoary and old&mdash;(when) fire broke
out in the midst thereof..., at that time I drenched that temple (with
water) in (all) its circuit."
</p>
<p>
From this extract it will be seen that Shalmaneser gives us, in Ushpia
or Aushpia, the name of a very early Assyrian viceroy, who in his belief
was the founder of the great temple of the god Ashur. He also tells us
that 159 years separated Erishu from a viceroy named Shamshi-Adad, and
that 580 years separated Shamshi-Adad from his own time. When these
inscriptions were first found they were hailed with considerable
satisfaction by historians, as they gave what seemed to be valuable
information for settling the chronology of the early patesis. But
confidence in the accuracy of Shalmaneser's reckoning was somewhat
shaken a few months afterwards by the discovery of a prism of
Esarhaddon, who gave in it a history of the same temple, but ascribed
totally different figures for the periods separating the reigns
of Erishu and Shamshi-Adad, and the temple's destruction by fire.
Esarhaddon agrees with Shalmaneser in ascribing the founding of the
temple to Ushpia, but he states that only 126 years (instead of 159
years) separated Erishu (whom he spells Irishu), the son of Ilu-shumma,
from Shamshi-Adad, the son of Bêl-kabi; and he adds that 434 years
(instead of 580 years) elapsed between Shamshi-Adad's restoration of the
temple and the time when it was burned down. As Shalmaneser I lived over
six hundred years earlier than Esarhaddon, he was obviously in a better
position to ascertain the periods at which the events recorded took
place, but the discrepancy between the figures he gives and those of
Esarhaddon is disconcerting. It shows that Assyrian scribes could make
bad mistakes in their reckoning, and it serves to cast discredit on the
absolute accuracy of the chronological notices contained in other
late Assyrian inscriptions. So far from helping to settle the unsolved
problems of Assyrian chronology, these two recent finds at Sherghat
have introduced fresh confusion, and Assyrian chronology for the earlier
periods is once more cast into the melting pot.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the recovery of the names of hitherto unknown early
rulers of Assyria, the recent excavations at Sherghat have enabled us to
ascertain the true reading of the name of Shalmaneser I's grandfather,
who reigned a considerable time after Assyria had gained her
independence. The name of this king has hitherto been read as Pudi-ilu,
but it is now shown that the signs composing the first part of the name
are not to be taken phonetically, but as ideographs, the true reading of
the name being Arik-dên-ilu, the signification of which is "Long
(i.e. far-reaching) is the judgment of God." Arik-dên-ilu was a great
conqueror, as were his immediate descendants, all of whom extended the
territory of Assyria. By strengthening the country and increasing her
resources they enabled Arik-dên-ilu 's great-grandson, Tukulti-Ninib I,
to achieve the conquest of Babylon itself. Concerning Tukulti-Ninib's
reign and achievements an interesting inscription has recently been
discovered. This is now preserved in the British Museum, and before
describing it we may briefly refer to another phase of the excavations
at Sherghat.

The mounds of Sherghat rise a considerable height above the level of
the plain, and are to a great extent of natural and not of artificial
formation. In fact, the existence of a group of high natural mounds at
this point on the bank of the Tigris must have led to its selection
by the early Assyrians as the site on which to build their first
stronghold. The mounds were already so high, from their natural
formation, that there was no need for the later Assyrian kings
to increase their height artificially (as they raised the chief
palace-mound at Nineveh), and the remains of the Assyrian buildings of
the early period are thus only covered by a few feet of débris and not
by masses of unburnt brick and artificially piled up soil. This fact
has considerably facilitated the systematic uncovering of the principal
mound that is now being carried out by Dr. Andrae.

<p>
Work has hitherto been confined to the northwest corner of the mound
around the ziggurat, or temple tower, and already considerable traces of
Assyrian buildings have been laid bare in this portion of the site. The
city wall on the northern side has been uncovered, as well as quays with
steps leading down to the water along the river front. Part of the
great temple of the god Ashur has been excavated, though a considerable
portion of it must be still covered by the modern Turkish fort at the
extreme northern point of the mounds; also part of a palace erected
by Ashur-nasir-pal has been identified. In fact, the work at Sherghat
promises to add considerably to our knowledge of ancient Assyrian
architecture.
</p>
<p>
The inscription of Tukulti-Ninib I, which was referred to above as
having been recently acquired by the trustees of the British Museum,
affords valuable information for the reconstruction of the history of
Assyria during the first half of the thirteenth century B.C.* It is seen
from the facts summarized that for our knowledge of the earlier
history of the country we have to depend to a large extent on short
brick-inscriptions and votive texts supplemented by historical
references in inscriptions of the later period. The only historical
inscription of any length belonging to the early Assyrian period,
which had been published up to a year ago, was the famous memorial slab
containing an inscription of Adad-nirari I, which was acquired by the
late Mr. George Smith some thirty years ago. Although purchased in
Mosul, the slab had been found by the natives in the mounds at Sherghat,
for the text engraved upon it in archaic Assyrian characters records the
restoration of a part of the temple of the god Ashur in the ancient city
of Ashur, the first capital of the Assyrians, now marked by the
mounds of Sherghat, which have already been described. The object of
Adad-nirari in causing the memorial slab to be inscribed was to record
the restoration of the portion of the temple which he had rebuilt,
but the most important part of the inscription was contained in the
introductory phrases with which the text opens. They recorded
the conquests achieved not only by Adad-nirari but by his father
Arik-dên-ilu, his grandfather Bél-nirari, and his great-grandfather
Ashur-uballit. They thus enabled the historian to trace the gradual
extension and consolidation of the Assyrian empire during a critical
period in its early history.
</p>

</pre>
<p>
The recently recovered memorial slab of Tukulti-Ninib I is similar to
that of his grandfather Adad-nirari I, and ranks in importance with it
for the light it throws on the early struggles of Assyria. Tukulti-Ninib
's slab, like that of Adad-nirari, was a foundation memorial intended to
record certain building operations carried out by order of the king.
The building so commemorated was not the restoration of a portion of
a temple, but the founding of a new city, in which the king erected
no less than eight temples dedicated to various deities, while he also
records that he built a palace therein for his own habitation, that he
protected the city by a strongly fortified wall, and that he cut a canal
from the Tigris by which he ensured a continuous supply of fresh water.
These were the facts which the memorial was primarily intended to
record, but, like the text of Adad-nirari I, the most interesting events
for the historian are those referred to in the introductory portions of
the inscription. Before giving details concerning the founding of the
new city, named Kar-Tukulti-Mnib, "the Fortress of Tukulti-Mnib,"
the king supplies an account of the military expeditions which he
had conducted during the course of his reign up to the time when the
foundation memorial was inscribed. These introductory paragraphs record
how the king gradually conquered the peoples to the north and northeast
of Assyria, and how he finally undertook a successful campaign against
Babylon, during which he captured the city and completely subjugated
both Northern and Southern Babylonia. Tukulti-Mnib's reign thus marks an
epoch in the history of his country.
</p>
<p>
We have already seen how, during the early ages of her history, Assyria
had been merely a subject province of the Babylonian empire. Her rulers
had been viceroys owing allegiance to their overlords in Babylon,
under whose orders they administered the country, while garrisons of
Babylonian soldiers, and troops commanded by Babylonian officers, served
to keep the country in a state of subjection. Gradually, however, the
country began to feel her feet and long for independence. The conquest
of Babylon by the kings of the Country of the Sea afforded her the
opportunity of throwing off the Babylonian yoke. In the fifteenth
century the Assyrian kings were powerful enough to have independent
relations with the kings of Egypt, and, during the two centuries which
preceded Tukulti-Mnib's reign.
</p>
<p>
Assyria's relations with Babylon were the cause of constant friction due
to the northern kingdom's growth in power and influence. The frontier
between the two countries was constantly in dispute, and, though
sometimes rectified by treaty, the claims of Assyria often led to war
between the two countries. The general result of these conflicts was
that Assyria gradually extended her authority farther southwards, and
encroached upon territory which had previously been Babylonian. The
successes gained by Ashur-uballit, Bêl-nirari, and Adad-nirari I against
the contemporary Babylonian kings had all resulted in the cession of
fresh territory to Assyria and in an increase of her international
importance. Up to the time of Tukulti-Mnib no Assyrian king had actually
seated himself upon the Babylonian throne. This feat was achieved by
Tukulti-Mnib, and his reign thus marks an important step in the gradual
advance of Assyria to the position which she later occupied as the
predominant power in Western Asia.
</p>
<p>
Before undertaking his campaign against Babylon, Tukulti-Mnib secured
himself against attack from other quarters, and his newly discovered
memorial inscription supplies considerable information concerning the
steps he took to achieve this object. In his inscription the king does
not number his military expeditions, and, with the exception of the
first one, he does not state the period of his reign in which they
were undertaken. The results of his campaigns are summarized in four
paragraphs of the text, and it is probable that they are not described
in chronological order, but are arranged rather according to the
geographical position of the districts which he invaded and subdued.
Tukulti-Ninib records that his first campaign took place at the
beginning of his sovereignty, in the first year of his reign, and it was
directed against the tribes and peoples inhabiting the territory on the
east of Assyria. Of the tribes which he overran and conquered on this
occasion the most important was the Kuti, who probably dwelt in the
districts to the east of the Lower Zâb. They were a turbulent race and
they had already been conquered by Arik-dên-ilu and Adad-nirari I, but
on neither occasion had they been completely subdued, and they had soon
regained their independence. Their subjugation by Tukulti-Ninib was
a necessary preliminary to any conquest in the south, and we can well
understand why it was undertaken by the king at the beginning of his
reign. Other conquests which were also made in the same region were the
Ukumanî and the lands of Elkhu-nia, Sharnida, and Mekhri, mountainous
districts which probably lay to the north of the Lower Zâb. The country
of Mekhri took its name from the mekhru-tree, a kind of pine or fir,
which grew there in abundance upon the mountainsides, and was highly
esteemed by the Assyrian kings as affording excellent wood for building
purposes. At a later period Ashur-nasir-pal invaded the country in the
course of his campaigns and brought back beams of mekhru-wood, which he
used in the construction of the temple dedicated to the goddess Ishtar
in Nineveh.
</p>
<p>
The second group of tribes and districts enumerated by Tukulti-Ninib as
having been subdued in his early years, before his conquest of Babylon,
all lay probably to the northwest of Assyria. The most powerful among
these peoples were the Shubari, who, like the Kutî on the eastern
border of Assyria, had already been conquered by Adad-nirari I, but had
regained their independence and were once more threatening the border on
this side. The third group of his conquests consisted of the districts
ruled over by forty kings of the lands of Na'iri, which was a general
term for the mountainous districts to the north of Assyria, including
territory to the west of Lake Van and extending eastwards to the
districts around Lake Urmi. The forty kings in this region whom
Tukulti-Ninib boasts of having subdued were little more than chieftains
of the mountain tribes, each one possessing authority over a few
villages scattered among the hills and valleys. But the men of Na'iri
were a warlike and hardy race, and, if left long in undisturbed
possession of their native fastnesses, they were tempted to make raids
into the fertile plains of Assyria. It was therefore only politic for
Tukulti-Ninib to traverse their country with fire and sword, and, by
exacting heavy tribute, to keep the fear of Assyrian power before their
eyes. From the king's records we thus learn that he subdued and crippled
the semi-independent races living on his borders to the north, to the
northwest, and to the east. On the west was the desert, from which
region he need fear no organized attack when he concentrated his army
elsewhere, for his permanent garrisons were strong enough to repel and
punish any incursion of nomadic tribes. He was thus in a position to try
conclusions with his hereditary foe in the south, without any fear of
leaving his land open to invasion in his absence.
</p>
<p>
The campaign against Babylon was the most important one undertaken by
Tukulti-Ninib, and its successful issue was the crowning point of his
military career. The king relates that the great gods Ashur, Bel, and
Shamash, and the goddess Ishtar, the queen of heaven and earth, marched
at the head of his warriors when he set out upon the expedition. After
crossing the border and penetrating into Babylonian territory he seems
to have had some difficulty in forcing Bitiliashu, the Kassite king who
then occupied the throne of Babylon, to a decisive engagement. But by
a skilful disposition of his forces he succeeded in hemming him in, so
that the Babylonian army was compelled to engage in a pitched battle.
The result of the fighting was a complete victory for the Assyrian arms.
Many of the Babylonian warriors fell fighting, and Bitiliashu himself
was captured by the Assyrian soldiers in the midst of the battle.
Tukulti-Ninib boasts that he trampled his lordly neck beneath his feet,
and on his return to Assyria he carried his captive back in fetters to
present him with the spoils of the campaign before Ashur, the national
god of the Assyrians.
</p>
<p>
Before returning to Assyria, however, Tukulti-Ninib marched with his
army throughout the length and breadth of Babylonia, and achieved
the subjugation of the whole of the Sumer and Akkad. He destroyed the
fortifications of Babylon to ensure that they should not again be used
against himself, and all the inhabitants who did not at once submit to
his decrees he put co the sword. He then appointed his own officers
to rule the country and established his own system of administration,
adding to his previous title of "King of Assyria," those of "King of
Karduniash (i. e. Babylonia)" and "King of Sumer and Akkad." It was
probably from this period that he also adopted the title of "King of the
Poor Quarters of the World." As a mark of the complete subjugation of
their ancient foe, Tukulti-Ninib and his army carried back with them
to Assyria not only the captive Babylonian king, but also the statue of
Marduk, the national god of Babylon. This they removed from B-sagila,
his sumptuous temple in Babylon, and they looted the sacred treasures
from the treasure-chambers, and carried them off together with the spoil
of the city.
</p>
<p>
Tukulti-Ninib no doubt left a sufficient proportion of his army in
Babylon to garrison the city and support the governors and officials
into whose charge he committed the administration of the land, but he
himself returned to Assyria with the rich spoil of the campaign, and
it was probably as a use for this large increase of wealth and material
that he decided to found another city which should bear his own name and
perpetuate it for future ages. The king records that he undertook this
task at the bidding of Bel (i.e. the god Ashur), who commanded that he
should found a new city and build a dwelling-place for him therein.
In accordance with the desire of Ashur and the gods, which was thus
conveyed to him, the king founded the city of Kar-Tukulti-Ninib, and
he erected therein temples dedicated not only to Ashur, but also to the
gods Adad, and Sha-mash, and Ninib, and Nusku, and Nergal, and Imina-bi,
and the goddess Ishtar. The spoils from Babylon and the temple treasures
from E-sagila were doubtless used for the decoration of these temples
and the adornment of their shrines, and the king endowed the temples and
appointed regular offerings, which he ordained should be their property
for ever. He also built a sumptuous palace for his own abode when he
stayed in the city, which he constructed on a mound or terrace of earth,
faced with brick, and piled high above the level of the city. Finally,
he completed its fortification by the erection of a massive wall around
it, and the completion of this wall was the occasion on which his
memorial tablet was inscribed.
</p>
<p>
The memorial tablet was buried and bricked up within the actual
structure of the wall, in order that in future ages it might be read by
those who found it, and so it might preserve his name and fame. After
finishing the account of his building operations in the new city and
recording the completion of the city wall from its foundation to its
coping stone, the king makes an appeal to any future ruler who should
find it, in the following words: "In the days that are to come, when
this wall shall have grown old and shall have fallen into ruins, may
a future prince repair the damaged parts thereof, and may he anoint my
memorial tablet with oil, and may he offer sacrifices and restore
it unto its place, and then Ashur will hearken unto his prayers. But
whosoever shall destroy this wall, or shall remove my memorial tablet or
my name that is inscribed thereon, or shall leave Kar-Tukulti-Ninib, the
city of my dominion, desolate, or shall destroy it, may the lord Ashur
overthrow his kingdom, and may he break his weapons, and may he cause
his warriors to be defeated, and may he diminish his boundaries, and may
he ordain that his rule shall be cut off, and on his days may he bring
sorrow, and his years may he make evil, and may he blot out his name and
his seed from the land!"
</p>
<p>
By such blessings and curses Tukulti-Ninib hoped to ensure the
preservation of his name and the rebuilding of his city, should it at
any time be neglected and fall into decay. Curiously enough, it was in
this very city that Tukulti-Ninib met his own fate less than seven years
after he had founded it. At that time one of his own sons, who bore the
name of Ashur-nasir-pal, conspired against his father and stirred up the
nobles to revolt. The insurrection was arranged when Tukulti-Ninib was
absent from his capital and staying in Kar-Tukulti-Ninib, where he was
probably protected by only a small bodyguard, the bulk of his veteran
warriors remaining behind in garrison at Ashur. The insurgent nobles,
headed by Ashur-nasir-pal, fell upon the king without warning when
he was passing through the city without any suspicion of risk from a
treacherous attack. The king defended himself and sought refuge in a
neighbouring house, but the conspirators surrounded the building and,
having forced an entrance, slew him with the sword. Thus Tukulti-Ninib
perished in the city he had built and beautified with the spoils of his
campaigns, where he had looked forward to passing a peaceful and secure
old age. Of the fate of the city itself we know little except that its
site is marked to-day by a few mounds which rise slightly above the
level of the surrounding desert. The king's memorial tablet only has
survived. For some 3,200 years it rested undisturbed in the foundations
of the wall of unburnt brick, where it was buried by Tukulti-Ninib on
the completion of the city wall.

Thence it was removed by the hands of modern Arabs, and it is now
preserved in the British Museum, where the characters of the inscription

graver inscribed them by order of the king.
</p>
<p>
In the account of his first campaign, which is preserved upon
the memorial tablet, it is stated that the peoples conquered by
Tukulti-Ninib brought their yearly tribute to the city of Ashur. This
fact is of considerable interest, for it proves that Tukulti-Ninib
restored the capital of Assyria to the city of Ashur, removing it from
Calah, whither it had been transferred by his father Shalmaneser I. The
city of Calah had been founded and built by Shalmaneser I in the same
way that his son Tukulti-Ninib built the city of Kar-Tukulti-Ninib, and
the building of both cities is striking evidence of the rapid growth
of Assyria and her need of expansion around fresh centres prepared for
administration and defence. The shifting of the Assyrian capital to
Calah by Shalmaneser I was also due to the extension of Assyrian power
in the north, in consequence of which there was need of having the
capital nearer the centre of the country so enlarged. Ashur's recovery
of her old position under Tukulti-Ninib I was only a temporary check to
this movement northwards, and, so long as Babylon remained a conquered
province of the Assyrian empire, obviously the need for a capital
farther north than Ashur would not have been pressing.

But with Tukulti-Ninib's death Babylon regained her independence and
freed herself from Assyrian control, and the centre of the northern
kingdom was once more subject to the influences which eventually
resulted in the permanent transference of her capital to Nineveh. To the
comparative neglect into which Ashur and Calah consequently fell, we
may probably trace the extensive remains of buildings belonging to the
earlier periods of Assyrian history which have been recovered and still
remain to be found, in the mounds that mark their sites.
</p>
<p>
We have given some account of the results already achieved from the
excavations carried out during the last two years at Sherghat, the site
of the city of Ashur. That much remains to be done on the site of Calah,
the other early capital of Assyria, is evident from even a cursory
examination of the present condition of the mounds that mark the
location of the city. These mounds are now known by the name of Nimrûd
and are situated on the left or eastern bank of the Tigris, a short
distance above the point at which it is joined by the stream of the
Upper Zâb, and the great mound which still covers the remains of the
ziggurat, or temple tower, can be seen from a considerable distance
across the plain. During the excavations formerly carried out here for
the British Museum, remains of palaces were recovered which had been
built or restored by Shal-maneser I, Ashur-nasir-pal, Shalmaneser II,
Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon, Esarhaddon, and Ashur-etil-ilâni. After the
conclusion of the diggings and the removal of many of the sculptures to
England, the site was covered again with earth, in order to protect the
remains of Assyrian buildings which were left in place. Since that time
the soil has sunk and been washed away by the rains so that many of the
larger sculptures are now protruding above the soil, an example of which
is seen in the two winged bulls in the palace of Ashur-nasir-pal. It
is improbable that the mounds of Nimrûd will yield such rich results
as Sherghat, but the site would probably well repay prolonged and
systematic excavation.
</p>
<p>
We have hitherto summarized and described the principal facts,
with regard to the early history of Babylonia and Assyria and the
neighbouring countries, which have been obtained from the excavations
conducted recently on the sites of ancient cities. From the actual
remains of the buildings that have been unearthed we have secured
information with regard to the temples and palaces of ancient rulers and
the plans on which they were designed. Erom the objects of daily life
and of religious use which have been recovered, such as weapons of
bronze and iron, and vessels of metal, stone, and clay, it is possible
for the archaeologist to draw conclusions with regard to the customs of
these early peoples; while from a study of their style and workmanship
and of such examples of their sculpture as have been brought to light,
he may determine the stage of artistic development at which they had
arrived. The clay tablets and stone monuments that have been recovered
reveal the family life of the people, their commercial undertakings,
their system of legislation and land tenure, their epistolary
correspondence, and the administration under which they lived, while the
royal inscriptions and foundation-memorials throw light on the religious
and historical events of the period in which they were inscribed.
Information on all these points has been acquired as the result of
excavation, and is based on the discoveries in the ruins of early cities
which have remained buried beneath the soil for some thousands of years.
But for the history of Assyria and of the other nations in the north
there is still another source of information to which reference must now
be made.
</p>
<p>
The kings of Assyria were not content with recording their achievements
on the walls of their buildings, on stelae set up in their palaces and
temples, on their tablets of annals preserved in their archive-chambers,
and on their cylinders and foundation-memorials concealed within the
actual structure of the buildings themselves. They have also left
records graven in the living rock, and these have never been buried,
but have been exposed to wind and weather from the moment they
were engraved. Records of irrigation works and military operations
successfully undertaken by Assyrian kings remain to this day on the
face of the mountains to the north and east of Assyria. The kings of
one great mountain race that had its capital at Van borrowed from the
Assyrians this method of recording their achievements, and, adopting the
Assyrian character, have left numerous rock-inscriptions in their own
language in the mountains of Armenia and Kurdistan. In some instances
the action of rain and frost has nearly if not quite obliterated the
record, and a few have been defaced by the hand of man. But as the
majority are engraved in panels cut on the sheer face of the rock, and
are inaccessible except by means of ropes and tackle, they have escaped
mutilation. The photograph reproduced will serve to show the means that
must be adopted for reaching such rock-inscriptions in order to examine
or copy them.

The inscription shown in the photograph is one of those cut by

flows, and can be reached only by climbing down ropes fixed to the top

inscriptions to be engraved was dictated by the desire to render it
difficult to destroy them, but it has also had the effect of delaying to
some extent their copying and decipherment by modern workers.

<p>
Considerable progress, however, has recently been made in identifying
and copying these texts, and we may here give a short account of what
has been done and of the information furnished by the inscriptions that
have been examined.
</p>
<p>
Recently considerable additions have been made to our knowledge of the
ancient empire of Van and of its relation to the later kings of Assyria
by the labours of Prof Lehmann and Dr. Belck on the inscriptions which
the kings of that period caused to be engraved upon the rocks among the
mountains of Armenia.
</p>
<a name="image-0035"><!--IMG--></a>

alt="415.jpg the Rock and Citadel of Van. 
">
</center>

<p>
The flat roofs of the houses of the city of Van may be seen to the left
of the photograph nestling below the rock.
</p>
<p>
The centre and capital of this empire was the ancient city which stood
on the site of the modern town of Van at the southwest corner of the
lake which bears the same name. The city was built at the foot of a
natural rock which rises precipitously from the plain, and must have
formed an impregnable stronghold against the attack of the foe.
</p>
<p>
In this citadel at the present day remain the ancient galleries and
staircases and chambers which were cut in the living rock by the kings
who made it their fortress, and their inscriptions, engraved upon the
face of the rock on specially prepared and polished surfaces, enable us
to reconstruct in some degree the history of that ancient empire. From
time to time there have been found and copied other similar texts, which
are cut on the mountainsides or on the massive stones which formed part
of the construction of their buildings and fortifications. A complete
collection of these texts, together with translations, will shortly be
published by Prof. Lehmann. Meanwhile, this scholar has discussed and
summarized the results to be obtained from much of his material, and
we are thus already enabled to sketch the principal achievements of the
rulers of this mountain race, who were constantly at war with the later
kings of Assyria, and for two centuries at least disputed her claim to
supremacy in this portion of Western Asia.
</p>
<p>
The country occupied by this ancient people of Van was the great
table-land which now forms Armenia. The people themselves cannot
be connected with the Armenians, for their language presents no
characteristics of those of the Indo-European family, and it is equally
certain that they are not to be traced to a Semitic origin. It is true
that they employed the Assyrian method of writing their inscriptions,
and their art differs only in minor points from that of the Assyrians,
but in both instances this similarity of culture was directly borrowed
at a time when the less civilized race, having its centre at Van, came
into direct contact with the Assyrians.

</center>

<p>
The exact date at which this influence began to be exerted is not
certain, but we have records of immediate relations with Assyria in the
second half of the ninth century before Christ. The district inhabited
by the Vannic people was known to the Assyrians by the name of Urartu,
and although the inscriptions of the earlier Assyrian kings do not
record expeditions against that country, they frequently make mention of
campaigns against princes and petty rulers of the land of Na'iri. They
must therefore for long have exercised an indirect, if not a direct,
influence on the peoples and tribes which lay more to the north.
</p>
<p>
The earliest evidence of direct contact between the Assyrians and the
land of Urartu which we at present possess dates from the reign of
Ashur-nasir-pal, and in the reign of his son Shalmaneser II three
expeditions were undertaken against the people of Van. The name of the
king of Urartu at this time was Arame, and his capital city, Arzasku,
probably lay to the north of Lake Van. On all three occasions the
Assyrians were victorious, forcing Arame to abandon his capital
and capturing his cities as far as the sources of the Euphrates.
Subsequently, in the year 833 B.C., Shalmaneser II made another attack
upon the country, which at that time was under the sway of Sarduris I.
Under this monarch the citadel of Van became the great stronghold of the
people of Urartu, for he added to the natural strength of the position
by the construction of walls built between the rock of Van and the
harbour. The massive blocks of stone of which his fortifications
were composed are standing at the present day, and they bear eloquent
testimony to the energy with which this monarch devoted himself to the
task of rendering his new citadel impregnable. The fortification and
strengthening of Van and its citadel was carried on during the reigns of
his direct successors and descendants, Ispui-nis, Menuas, and Argistis
I, so that when Tiglath-pile-ser III brought fire and sword into the
country and laid siege to Van in the reign of Sarduris II, he could not
capture the citadel.
</p>

alt="419.jpg Part of the Ancient Fortifications Of The City Of
Van, Between the Citadel and The Lake. 
">
</center>

<p>
It was not difficult for the Assyrian king to assault and capture the
city itself, which lay at the foot of the citadel as it does at the
present day, but the latter, within the fortifications of which Sarduris
and his garrison withdrew, proved itself able to withstand the Assyrian
attack. The expedition of Tiglath-pileser III did not succeed in
crushing the Vannic empire, for Rusas I, the son and successor of
Sarduris II, allied himself to the neighbouring mountain races and gave
considerable trouble to Sargon, the Assyrian king, who was obliged to
undertake an expedition to check their aggressions.
</p>
<p>
It was probably Rusas I who erected the buildings on Toprak Kala, the
hill to the east of Van, traces of which remain to the present day. He
built a palace and a temple, and around them he constructed a new city
with a reservoir to supply it with water, possibly because the slopes
of Toprak Kala rendered it easier of defence than the city in the
plain (beneath the rock and citadel) which had fallen an easy prey to
Tiglath-pileser III. The site of the temple on Toprak Kala has been
excavated by the trustees of the British Museum, and our knowledge of
Vannic art is derived from the shields and helmets of bronze and small
bronze figures and fittings which were recovered from this building. One
of the shields brought to the British Museum from the Toprak Kala, where
it originally hung with others on the temple walls, bears the name of
Argistis II, who was the son and successor of Rusas I, and who attempted
to give trouble to the Assyrians by stirring the inhabitants of the land
of Kummukh (Kommagene) to revolt against Sargon. His son, Rusas II,
was the contemporary of Esarhaddon, and from some recently discovered
rock-inscriptions we learn that he extended the limits of his kingdom on
the west and secured victories against Mushki (Meshech) to the southeast
of the Halys and against the Hittites in Northern Syria. Rusas III
rebuilt the temple on Toprak Kala, as we know from an inscription of his
on one of the shields from that place in the British Museum. Both he and
Sarduris III were on friendly terms with the Assyrians, for we know that
they both sent embassies to Ashur-bani-pal.
</p>
<p>
By far the larger number of rock-inscriptions that have yet been found
and copied in the mountainous districts bordering on Assyria were
engraved by this ancient Vannic people, and Drs. Lehmann and Belck have
done good service by making careful copies and collations of all those
which are at present known. Work on other classes of rock-inscriptions
has also been carried on by other travellers. A new edition of the
inscriptions of Sennacherib in the gorge of the Gomel, near the village
of Bavian, has been made by Mr. King, who has also been fortunate enough
to find a number of hitherto unknown inscriptions in Kurdistan on the
Judi Dagh and at the sources of the Tigris. The inscriptions at
the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb, "the Dog River," in Syria, have
been reexamined by Dr. Knudtzon, and the long inscription which
Nebuchadnezzar II cut on the rocks at Wadi Brissa in the Lebanon,
formerly published by M. Pognon, has been recopied by Dr. Weissbach.
Finally, the great trilingual inscription of Darius Hystaspes on the
rock at Bisutun in Persia, which was formerly copied by the late Sir
Henry Raw-linson and used by him for the successful decipherment of the
cuneiform inscriptions, was completely copied last year by Messrs. King
and Thompson.

     Messrs. King and Thompson are preparing a new edition of
     this inscription.

<p>
The main facts of the history of Assyria under her later kings and of
Babylonia during the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods were many years
ago correctly ascertained, and recent excavation and research have done
little to add to our knowledge of the history of these periods. It was
hoped that the excavations conducted by Dr. Koldewey at Babylon would
result in the recovery of a wealth of inscriptions and records referring
to the later history of the country, but unfortunately comparatively
few tablets or inscriptions have been found, and those that have been
recovered consist mainly of building-inscriptions and votive texts. One
such building-inscription contains an interesting historical reference.
It occurs on a barrel-cylinder of clay inscribed with a text of
Nabopolassar, and it was found in the temple of Ninib and records the
completion and restoration of the temple by the king. In addition to
recording the building operations he had carried out in the temple,
Nabopolassar boasts of his opposition to the Assyrians. He says: "As for
the Assyrians who had ruled all peoples from distant days and had set
the people of the land under a heavy yoke, I, the weak and humble man
who worshippeth the Lord of Lords (i.e. the god Marduk), through the
mighty power of Nabû and Marduk, my lords, held back their feet from the
land of Akkad and cast off their yoke."
</p>
<p>
It is not yet certain whether the Babylonians under Nabopolassar
actively assisted Cyaxares and the Medes in the siege and in the
subsequent capture of Nineveh in 606 B.C. but this newly discovered
reference to the Assyrians by Nabopolassar may possibly be taken
to imply that the Babylonians were passive and not active allies of
Cyaxares. If the cylinder were inscribed after the fall of Nineveh we
should have expected Nabopolassar, had he taken an active part in the
capture of the city, to have boasted in more definite terms of his
achievement. On his stele which is preserved at Constantinople,
Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian empire, who himself
suffered defeat at the hands of Cyrus, King of Persia, ascribed the fall
of Nineveh to the anger of Marduk and the other gods of Babylon because
of the destruction of their city and the spoliation of their temples by
Sennacherib in 689 B.C. We see the irony of fate in the fact that Cyrus
also ascribed the defeat and deposition of Nabonidus and the fall of
Babylon to Marduk's intervention, whose anger he alleges was aroused
by the attempt of Nabonidus to concentrate the worship of the local
city-gods in Babylon.
</p>
<p>
Thus it will be seen that recent excavation and research have not
yet supplied the data for filling in such gaps as still remain in our
knowledge of the later history of Assyria and Babylon. The closing
years of the Assyrian empire and the military achievements of the great
Neo-Babylonian rulers, Nabopolassar, Nerig-lissar, and Nebuchadnezzar
II, have not yet been found recorded in any published Assyrian or
Babylonian inscription, but it may be expected that at any moment
some text will be discovered that will throw light upon the problems
connected with the history of those periods which still await solution.
Meanwhile, the excavations at Babylon, although they have not added
much to our knowledge of the later history of the country, have been
of immense service in revealing the topography of the city during the
Neo-Babylonian period, as well as the positions, plans, and characters
of the principal buildings erected by the later Babylonian kings. The
discovery of the palaces of Nebuchadnezzar II on the mound of the Kasr,
of the small but complete temple E-makh, of the temple of the goddess
Nin-makh to the northeast of the palaces, and of the sacred road
dividing them and passing through the Great Gate of Ishtar (adorned with
representations of lions, bulls, and dragons in raised brick upon its
walls) has enabled us to form some conception of the splendour and
magnificence of the city as it appeared when rebuilt by its last native
rulers. Moreover, the great temple E-sagila, the famous shrine of the
god Marduk, has been identified and partly excavated beneath the huge
mound of Tell Amran ibn-Ali, while a smaller and less famous temple of
Ninib has been discovered in the lower mounds which lie to the eastward.
Finally, the sacred way from E-sagila to the palace mound has been
traced and uncovered. We are thus enabled to reconstitute the scene of
the most solemn rite of the Babylonian festival of the New Year, when
the statue of the god Marduk was carried in solemn procession along this
road from the temple to the palace, and the Babylonian king made his
yearly obeisance to the national god, placing his own hands within those
of Marduk, in token of his submission to and dependence on the divine
will.

<p>
Though recent excavations have not led to any startling discoveries
with regard to the history of Western Asia during the last years of
the Babylonian empire, research among the tablets dating from the
Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods has lately added considerably to our
knowledge of Babylonian literature. These periods were marked by great
literary activity on the part of the priests at Babylon, Sippar, and
elsewhere, who, under the royal orders, scoured the country for all
remains of the early literature which was preserved in the ancient
temples and archives of the country, and made careful copies and
collections of all they found. Many of these tablets containing
Neo-Babylonian copies of earlier literary texts are preserved in the
British Museum, and have been recently published, and we have thus
recovered some of the principal grammatical, religious, and magical
compositions of the earlier Babylonian period.

<p>
Among the most interesting of such recent finds is a series of tablets
inscribed with the Babylonian legends concerning the creation of the
world and man, which present many new and striking parallels to the
beliefs on these subjects embodied in Hebrew literature. We have not
space to treat this subject at greater length in the present work, but
we may here note that discovery and research in its relation to the
later empires that ruled at Babylon have produced results of literary
rather than of historical importance. But we should exceed the space
at our disposal if we attempted even to skim this fascinating field of
study in which so much has recently been achieved. For it is time we
turned once more to Egypt and directed our inquiry towards ascertaining
what recent research has to tell us with regard to her inhabitants
during the later periods of her existence as a nation of the ancient
world.

<h2>
    CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE LAST DAYS OF ANCIENT EGYPT
</h2>
<p>
Before we turned from Egypt to summarize the information, afforded by
recent discoveries, upon the history of Western Asia under the kings
of the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, we noted that the Asiatic
empire of Egypt was regained by the reactionary kings of the XIXth
Dynasty, after its temporary loss owing to the vagaries of Akhunaten.
Palestine remained Egyptian throughout the period of the judges until
the foundation of the kingdom of Judah. With the decline of military
spirit in Egypt and the increasing power of the priesthood, authority
over Asia became less and less a reality. Tribute was no longer paid,
and the tribes wrangled without a restraining hand, during the reigns of
the successors of Ramses III. By the time of the priest-kings of Thebes
(the XXIst Dynasty) the authority of the Pharaohs had ceased to be
exercised in Syria. Egypt was itself divided into two kingdoms, the one
ruled by Northern descendants of the Ramessids at Tanis, the other by
the priestly monarchs at Thebes, who reigned by right of inheritance as
a result of the marriage of the daughter of Ramses with the high
priest Amenhetep, father of Herhor, the first priest-king. The Thebans
fortified Gebelên in the South and el-Hêbi in the North against attack,
and evidently their relations with the Tanites were not always friendly.
</p>
<p>
In Syria nothing of the imperial power remained. The prestige of the god
Amen of Thebes, however, was still very great. We see this clearly from
a very interesting papyrus of the reign of Herhor, published in 1899 by
Mr. Golenischeff, which describes the adventures of Uenuamen, an envoy
sent (about 1050 B.C.) to Phoenicia to bring wood from the mountains of
Lebanon for the construction of a great festival bark of the god Amen
at Thebes. In the course of his mission he was very badly treated
(We cannot well imagine Thothmes III or Amenhetep III tolerating
ill-treatment of their envoy!) and eventually shipwrecked on the coast
of the land of Alashiya or Cyprus. He tells us in the papyrus, which
seems to be the official report of his mission, that, having been given
letters of credence to the Prince of Byblos from the King of Tanis,
"to whom Amen had given charge of his North-land," he at length reached
Phoenicia, and after much discussion and argument was able to prevail
upon the prince to have the wood which he wanted brought down from
Lebanon to the seashore.
</p>
<p>
Here, however, a difficulty presented itself,&mdash;the harbour was filled
with the piratical ships of the Cretan Tjakaray, who refused to allow
Uenuamen to return to Egypt. They said, 'Seize him; let no ship of his
go unto the land of Egypt!' "Then," says Uenuamen in the papyrus, "I sat
down and wept. The scribe of the prince came out unto me; he said unto
me, 'What ail-eth thee?' I replied, 'Seest thou not the birds which fly,
which fly back unto Egypt? Look at them, they go unto the cool canal,
and how long do I remain abandoned here? Seest thou not those who would
prevent my return?' He went away and spoke unto the prince, who began
to weep at the words which were told unto him and which were so sad. He
sent his scribe out unto me, who brought me two measures of wine and a
deer. He sent me Tentnuet, an Egyptian singing-girl who was with him,
saying unto her, 'Sing unto him, that he may not grieve!' He sent word
unto me, 'Eat, drink, and grieve not! To-morrow shalt thou hear all that
I shall say.' On the morrow he had the people of his harbour summoned,
and he stood in the midst of them, and he said unto the Tjakaray, 'What
aileth you?' They answered him, 'We will pursue the piratical ships
which thou sendest unto Egypt with our unhappy companions.' He said unto
them, 'I cannot seize the ambassador of Amen in my land. Let me send him
away and then do ye pursue after him to seize him!' He sent me on board,
and he sent me away... to the haven of the sea. The wind drove me upon
the land of Alashiya. The people of the city came out in order to slay
me. I was dragged by them to the place where Hatiba, the queen of the
city, was. I met her as she was going out of one of her houses into
the other. I greeted her and said unto the people who stood by her, 'Is
there not one among you who understandeth the speech of Egypt?' One
of them replied, 'I understand it.' I said unto him, 'Say unto thy
mistress: even as far as the city in which Amen dwelleth (i. e. Thebes)
have I heard the proverb, "In all cities is injustice done; only in
Alashiya is justice to be found," and now is injustice done here every
day!' She said, 'What is it that thou sayest?' I said unto her, 'Since
the sea raged and the wind drove me upon the land in which thou livest,
therefore thou wilt not allow them to seize my body and to kill me, for
verily I am an ambassador of Amen. Remember that I am one who will be
sought for always. And if these men of the Prince of Byblos whom they
seek to kill (are killed), verily if their chief finds ten men of thine,
will he not kill them also?' She summoned the men, and they were brought
before her. She said unto me, 'Lie down and sleep...'"
</p>
<p>
At this point the papyrus breaks off, and we do not know how Uenuamen
returned to Egypt with his wood. The description of his casting-away and
landing on Alashiya is quite Homeric, and gives a vivid picture of the
manners of the time. The natural impulse of the islanders is to kill
the strange castaway, and only the fear of revenge and of the wrath of a
distant foreign deity restrains them. Alashiya is probably Cyprus, which
also bore the name Yantinay from the time of Thothmes III until the
seventh century, when it is called Yatnan by the Assyrians. A king
of Alashiya corresponded with Amenhetep III in cuneiform on terms of
perfect equality, three hundred years before: "Brother," he writes,
"should the small amount of the copper which I have sent thee be
displeasing unto thy heart, it is because in my land the hand of Nergal
my lord slew all the men of my land (i.e. they died of the plague), and
there was no working of copper; and this was, my brother, not pleasing
unto thy heart. Thy messenger with my messenger swiftly will I send, and
whatsoever amount of copper thou hast asked for, O my brother, I,
even I, will send it unto thee." The mention by Herhor's envoy of
Nesibinebdad (Smendes), the King of Tanis, a powerful ruler who in
reality constantly threatened the existence of the priestly monarchy
at Thebes, as "him to whom Amen has committed the wardship of his
North-land," is distinctly amusing. The hard fact of the independence of
Lower Egypt had to be glozed somehow.
</p>
<p>
The days of Theban power were coming to an end and only the prestige
of the god Amen remained strong for two hundred years more. But the
alliance of Amen and his priests with a band of predatory and destroying
foreign conquerors, the Ethiopians (whose rulers were the descendants
of the priest-kings, who retired to Napata on the succession of the
powerful Bubastite dynasty of Shishak to that of Tanis, abandoning
Thebes to the Northerners), did much to destroy the prestige of Amen
and of everything connected with him. An Ethiopian victory meant only
an Assyrian reconquest, and between them Ethiopians and Assyrians had
well-nigh ruined Egypt. In the Saïte period Thebes had declined greatly
in power as well as in influence, and all its traditions were anathema
to the leading people of the time, although not of course in Akhunaten's
sense.
</p>
<p>
With the Saïte period we seem almost to have retraced our steps and to
have reentered the age of the Pyramid Builders. All the pomp and glory
of Thothmes, Amenhetep, and Ramses were gone. The days of imperial Egypt
were over, and the minds of men, sickened of foreign war, turned for
peace and quietness to the simpler ideals of the IVth and Vth Dynasties.
We have already seen that an archaistic revival of the styles of the
early dynasties is characteristic of this late period, and that men
were buried at Sakkâra and at Thebes in tombs which recall in form and
decoration those of the courtiers of the Pyramid Builders. Everywhere
we see this fashion of archaism. A Theban noble of this period named
Aba was buried at Thebes. Long ago, nearly three thousand years before,
under the VIth Dynasty, there had lived a great noble of the same name,
who was buried in a rock-tomb at Dêr el-Gebrâwî, in Middle Egypt. This
tomb was open and known in the days of the second Aba, who caused to be
copied and reproduced in his tomb in the Asasîf at Thebes most of the
scenes from the bas-relief with which it had been decorated. The tomb
of the VIth Dynasty Aba has lately been copied for the Archaeological
Survey of Egypt (Egypt Exploration Fund) by Mr. de Garis Davies, who has
found the reliefs of the XXVIth Dynasty Aba of considerable use to him
in reconstituting destroyed portions of their ancient originals.

<p>
During late years important discoveries of objects of this era have been
few. One of the most noteworthy is that of a contemporary inscription
describing the battle of Momemphis, which is mentioned by Herodotus (ii,
163, 169). We now have the official account of this battle, and know
that it took place in the third year of the reign of Amasis&mdash;not before
he became king. This was the fight in which the unpatriotic king,
Apries, who had paid for his partiality for the Greeks of Nau-kratis
with the loss of his throne, was finally defeated. As we see from this
inscription, he was probably murdered by the country people during his
flight.
</p>
<p>
The following are the most important passages of the inscription: "His
Majesty (Amasis) was in the Festival-Hall, discussing plans for his
whole land, when one came to say unto him, 'Hââ-ab-Râ (Apries) is rowing
up; he hath gone on board the ships which have crossed over. Haunebu
(Greeks), one knows not their number, are traversing the North-land,
which is as if it had no master to rule it; he (Apries) hath summoned
them, they are coming round him. It is he who hath arranged their
settlement in the Peh-ân (the An-dropolite name); they infest the whole
breadth of Egypt, those who are on thy waters fly before them!'... His
Majesty mounted his chariot, having taken lance and bow in his hand...
(the enemy) reached Andropolis; the soldiers sang with joy on the
roads... they did their duty in destroying the enemy. His Majesty fought
like a lion; he made victims among them, one knows not how many. The
ships and their warriors were overturned, they saw the depths as do the
fishes. Like a flame he extended, making a feast of fighting. His heart
rejoiced.... The third year, the 8th Athyr, one came to tell Majesty:
'Let their vile-ness be ended! They throng the roads, there are
thousands there ravaging the land; they fill every road. Those who are
in ships bear thy terror in their hearts. But it is not yet finished.'
Said his Majesty unto his soldiers: '...Young men and old men, do this
in the cities and nomes!'... Going upon every road, let not a day pass
without fighting their galleys!'... The land was traversed as by the
blast of a tempest, destroying their ships, which were abandoned by the
crews. The people accomplished their fate, killing the prince (Apries)
on his couch, when he had gone to repose in his cabin. When he saw his
friend overthrown... his Majesty himself buried him (Apries), in order
to establish him as a king possessing virtue, for his Majesty decreed
that the hatred of the gods should be removed from him."
</p>
<p>
This is the event to which we have already referred in a preceding
chapter, as proving the great amelioration of Egyptian ideas with regard
to the treatment of a conquered enemy, as compared with those of other
ancient nations. Amasis refers to the deposed monarch as his "friend,"
and buries him in a manner befitting a king at the charges of Amasis
himself. This act warded off from the spirit of Apries the just anger
of the gods at his partiality for the "foreign devils," and ensured his
reception by Osiris as a king neb menkh, "possessing virtues."
</p>
<p>
The town of Naukratis, where Apries established himself, had been
granted to the Greek traders by Psametik I a century or more before. Mr.
D. G. Hogarth's recent exploration of the site has led to a considerable
modification of our first ideas of the place, which were obtained
from Prof. Petrie 's excavations. Prof. Petrie was the discoverer of
Naukratis, and his diggings told us what Naukratis was like in the first
instance, but Mr. Hogarth has shown that several of his identifications
were erroneous and that the map of the place must be redrawn. The chief
error was in the placing of the Hellenion (the great meeting-place of
the Greeks), which is now known to be in quite a different position from
that assigned to it by Prof. Petrie. The "Great Temenos" of Prof. Petrie
has now been shown to be non-existent. Mr. Hogarth has also pointed out
that an old Egyptian town existed at Nau-kratis long before the Greeks
came there. This town is mentioned on a very interesting stele of black
basalt (discovered at Tell Gaif, the site of Naukratis, and now in the
Cairo Museum), under the name of "Permerti, which is called Nukrate."
The first is the old Egyptian name, the second the Greek name adapted
to Egyptian hieroglyphs. The stele was erected by Tekhtnebf, the last
native king of Egypt, to commemorate his gifts to the temples of Neïth
on the occasion of his accession at Sais. It is beautifully cut, and the
inscription is written in a curious manner, with alphabetic spellings
instead of ideographs, and ideographs instead of alphabetic spellings,
which savours fully of the affectation of the learned pedant who drafted
it; for now, of course, in the fourth century before Christ, nobody but
a priestly antiquarian could read hieroglyphics. Demotic was the only
writing for practical purposes.
</p>
<p>
We see this fact well illustrated in the inscriptions of the Ptolemaïc
temples. The accession of the Ptolemies marked a great increase in the
material wealth of Egypt, and foreign conquest again came in fashion.
Ptolemy Euergetes marched into Asia in the grand style of a Ramses and
brought back the images of gods which had been carried off by Esarhaddon
or Nebuchadnezzar II centuries before. He was received on his return
to Egypt with acclamations as a true successor of the Pharaohs. The
imperial spirit was again in vogue, and the archaistic simplicity and
independence of the Saïtes gave place to an archaistic imperialism, the
first-fruits of which were the repair and building of temples in the
great Pharaonic style. On these we see the Ptolemies masquerading as
Pharaohs, and the climax of absurdity is reached when Ptolemy Auletes
(the Piper) is seen striking down Asiatic enemies in the manner of
Amen-hetep or Ramses! This scene is directly copied from a Ramesside
temple, and we find imitations of reliefs of Ramses II so slavish that
the name of the earlier king is actually copied, as well as the relief,
and appears above the figure of a Ptolemy. The names of the nations who
were conquered by Thothmes III are repeated on Ptolemaic sculptures to
do duty for the conquered of Euergetes, with all sorts of mistakes
in spelling, naturally, and also with later interpolations. Such an
inscription is that in the temple of Kom Ombo, which Prof. Say ce has
held to contain the names of "Caphtor and Casluhim" and to prove the
knowledge of the latter name in the fourteenth century before Christ.
The name of Caphtor is the old Egyptian Keftiu (Crete); that of Casluhim
is unknown in real Old Egyptian inscriptions, and in this Ptolemaic list
at Kom Ombo it may be quite a late interpolation in the lists, perhaps
no older than the Persian period, since we find the names of Parsa
(Persia) and Susa, which were certainly unknown to Thothmes III,
included in it. We see generally from the Ptolemaic inscriptions that
nobody could read them but a few priests, who often made mistakes. One
of the most serious was the identification of Keftiu with Phoenicia in
the Stele of Canopus. This misled modern archaeologists down to the
time of Dr. Evans's discoveries at Knossos, though how these utterly
un-Semitic looking Keftiu could have been Phoenicians was a puzzle to
everybody. We now know, of course, that they were Mycenaean or
Minoan Cretans, and that the Ptolemaic antiquaries made a mistake in
identifying the land of Keftiu with Phoenicia.
</p>
<p>
We must not, however, say too much in dispraise of the Ptolemaic
Egyptians and their works. We have to be grateful to them indeed for the
building of the temples of Edfu and Dendera, which, owing to their later
date, are still in good preservation, while the best preserved of the
old Pharaonic fanes, such as Medinet Habû, have suffered considerably
from the ravages of time. Eor these temples show us to-day what an
old Egyptian temple, when perfect, really looked like. They are, so to
speak, perfect mummies of temples, while of the old buildings we have
nothing but the disjointed and damaged skeletons.
</p>
<p>
A good deal of repairing has been done to these buildings, especially
to that at Edfu, of late years. But the main archaeological interest of
Ptolemaic and Roman times has been found in the field of epigraphy and
the study of papyri, with which the names of Messrs. Kenyon, Grenfell,
and Hunt are chiefly connected. The treasures which have lately been
obtained by the British Museum in the shape of the manuscripts of
Aristotle's "Constitution of Athens," the lost poems of Bacchylides, and
the Mimes of Herondas, all of which have been published for the trustees
of that institution by Mr. Kenyon, are known to those who are interested
in these subjects. The long series of publications of Messrs.
Grenfell and Hunt, issued at the expense of the Egypt Exploration Fund
(Graeco-Roman branch), with the exception of the volume of discoveries
at Teb-tunis, which was issued by the University of California, is also
well known.
</p>
<p>
The two places with which Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt's work has been
chiefly connected are the Fayyûm and Behnesâ, the site of the ancient
Permje or Oxyr-rhynchus. The lake-province of the Fayyûm, which attained
such prominence in the days of the XIIth Dynasty, seems to have had
little or no history during the whole period of the New Empire, but in
Ptolemaic times it revived and again became one of the richest and
most important provinces of Egypt. The town of Arsinoë was founded at
Crocodilopolis, where are now the mounds of Kom el-Fâris (The Mound of
the Horseman), near Medinet el-Payyum, and became the capital of the
province. At Illahûn, just outside the entrance to the Fayyûm, was the
great Nile harbour and entrepôt of the lake-district, called Ptolemaïs
Hormos.
</p>
<p>
The explorations of Messrs. Hogarth, Grenfell, and Hunt in the years
of 1895-6 and 1898-9 resulted in the identification of the sites of the
ancient cities of Karanis (Kom Ushîm), Bacchias (Omm el-'Atl), Euhemeria
(Kasr el-Banât), Theadelphia (Harît), and Philoteris (Wadfa). The work
for the University of California in 18991900 at Umm el-Baragat showed
that this place was Tebtunis. Dime, on the northern coast of the Birket
Karûn, the modern representative of the ancient Lake Moeris, is now
known to be the ancient Sokno-paiou Nesos (the Isle of Soknopaios), a
local form of Sebek, the crocodile-god of the Fayyûm. At Karanis this
god was worshipped under the name of Petesuchos ("He whom Sebek
has given"), in conjunction with Osiris Pnepherôs (P-nefer-ho,
"the beautiful of face"); at Tebtunis he became Seknebtunis., i.e.
Sebek-neb-Teb-tunis (Sebek, lord of Tebtunis). This is a typical example
of the portmanteau pronunciations of the latter-day Egyptians.
</p>
<p>
Many very interesting discoveries were made during the course of the
excavations of these places (besides Mr. Hogarth's find of the temple
of Petesuchos and Pnepherôs at Karanis), consisting of Roman pottery
of varied form and Roman agricultural implements, including a perfect
plough.* The main interest of all, however, lies, both here and at
Behnesâ, in the papyri. They consist of Greek and Latin documents of
all ages from the early Ptolemaic to the Christian. In fact, Messrs.
Grenfell and Hunt have been unearthing and sifting the contents of the
waste-paper baskets of the ancient Ptolemaic and Roman Egyptians, which
had been thrown out on to dust-heaps near the towns. Nothing perishes
in,, the dry climate and soil of Egypt, so the contents of the ancient
dust-heaps have been preserved intact until our own day, and have been
found by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt, just as the contents of the houses
of the ancient Indian rulers of Chinese Turkestan, at Niya and Khotan,
with their store of Kha-roshthi documents, have been preserved intact in
the dry Tibetan desert climate and have been found by Dr. Stein.** There
is much analogy between the discoveries of Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt in
Egypt and those of Dr. Stein in Turkestan.

The Græco-Egyptian documents are of all kinds, consisting of letters,
lists, deeds, notices, tax-assessments, receipts, accounts, and business
records of every sort and kind, besides new fragments of classical
authors and the important "Sayings of Jesus," discovered at Behnesâ,
which have been published in a special popular form by the Egypt
Exploration Fund.*

These last fragments of the oldest Christian literature, which are
of such great importance and interest to all Christians, cannot be
described or discussed here. The other documents are no less
important to the student of ancient literature, the historian, and the
sociologist. The classical fragments include many texts of lost authors,
including Menander. We will give a few specimens of the private
letters and documents, which will show how extremely modern the ancient
Egyptians were, and how little difference there actually is between our
civilization and theirs, except in the-matter of mechanical invention.
They had no locomotives and telephones; otherwise they were the same. We
resemble them much more than we resemble our mediaeval ancestors or even
the Elizabethans.

This is a boy's letter to his father, who would not take him up to town
with him to see the sights: "Theon to his father Theon, greeting. It was
a fine thing of you not to take me with you to the city! If you won't
take me with you to Alexandria, I won't write you a letter, or speak to
you, or say good-bye to you; and if you go to Alexandria I won't take
your hand or ever greet you again. That is what will happen if you
won't take me. Mother said to Archelaus, 'It quite upsets him to be left
behind.' It was good of you to send me presents on the 12th, the day
you sailed. Send me a lyre, I implore you. If you don't, I won't eat, I
won't drink: there now!'" Is not this more like the letter of a spoiled
child of to-day than are the solemnly dutiful epistles of even our
grandfathers and grandmothers when young? The touch about "Mother said
to Archelaus, 'It quite upsets him to be left behind'" is delightfully
like the modern small boy, and the final request and threat are also
eminently characteristic.

Here is a letter asking somebody to redeem the writer's property from
the pawnshop: "Now please redeem my property from Sarapion. It is
pledged for two minas. I have paid the interest up to the month Epeiph,
at the rate of a stater per mina. There is a casket of incense-wood,
and another of onyx, a tunic, a white veil with a real purple border, a
handkerchief, a tunic with a Laconian stripe, a garment of purple linen,
two armlets, a necklace, a coverlet, a figure of Aphrodite, a cup, a big
tin flask, and a wine-jar. From Onetor get the two bracelets. They have
been pledged since the month Tybi of last year for eight... at the
rate of a stater per mina. If the cash is insufficient owing to the
carelessness of Theagenis, if, I say, it is insufficient, sell the
bracelets and make up the money." Here is an affectionate letter of
invitation: "Greeting, my dear Serenia, from Petosiris. Be sure, dear,
to come up on the 20th for the birthday festival of the god, and let me
know whether you are coming by boat or by donkey, that we may send for
you accordingly. Take care not to forget."

Claudianus, the mayor, from Dionysos, public physician. I was to-day
instructed by you, through Herakleides your assistant, to inspect the
body of a man who had been found hanged, named Hierax, and to report to
you my opinion of it. I therefore inspected the body in the presence
of the aforesaid Herakleides at the house of Epagathus in the Broadway
ward, and found it hanged by a noose, which fact I accordingly report."
Dated in the twelfth year of Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 173).

The above translations are taken, slightly modified, from those in The
Oxyrrhynchus Papyri, vol. i. The next specimen, a quaint letter, is
translated from the text in Mr. Grenfell's Greek Papyri (Oxford, 1896),
p. 69: "To Noumen, police captain and mayor, from Pokas son of Onôs,
unpaid policeman. I have been maltreated by Peadius the priest of the
temple of Sebek in Crocodilopolis. On the first epagomenal day of the
eleventh year, after having abused me about... in the aforesaid temple,
the person complained against sprang upon me and in the presence of
witnesses struck me many blows with a stick which he had. And as part of
my body was not covered, he tore my shirt, and this fact I called upon
the bystanders to bear witness to. Wherefore I request that if it seems
proper you will write to Klearchos the headman to send him to you, in
order that, if what I have written is true, I may obtain justice at your
hands."
</p>
<p>
A will of Hadrian's reign, taken from the Oxyrrhynchus Papyri (i, p.
173), may also be of interest: "This is the last will and testament,
made in the street (i.e. at a street notary's stand), of Pekysis, son of
Hermes and Didyme, an inhabitant of Oxyrrhynchus, being sane and in his
right mind. So long as I live, I am to have powers over my property,
to alter my will as I please. But if I die with this will unchanged, I
devise my daughter Ammonous whose mother is Ptolema, if she survive me,
but if not then her children, heir to my shares in the common house,
court, and rooms situate in the Cretan ward. All the furniture,
movables, and household stock and other property whatever that I shall
leave, I bequeath to the mother of my children and my wife Ptolema, the
freedwoman of Demetrius, son of Hermippus, with the condition that
she shall have for her lifetime the right of using, dwelling in, and
building in the said house, court, and rooms. If Ammonous should die
without children and intestate, the share of the fixtures shall belong
to her half-brother on the mother's side, Anatas, if he survive, but if
not, to... No one shall violate the terms of this my will under pain of
paying to my daughter and heir Ammonous a fine of 1,000 drachmae and to
the treasury an equal sum." Here follow the signatures of testator and
witnesses, who are described, as in a passport, one of them as follows:
"I, Dionysios, son of Dionysios of the same city, witness the will of
Pekysis. I am forty-six years of age, have a curl over my right temple,
and this is my seal of Dionysoplaton."
</p>
<p>
During the Roman period, which we have now reached in our survey, the
temple building of the Ptolemies was carried on with like energy. One of
the best-known temples of the Roman period is that at Philse, which
is known as the "Kiosk," or "Pharaoh's Bed." Owing to the great
picturesqueness of its situation, this small temple, which was built in
the reign of Trajan, has been a favourite subject for the painters of
the last fifty years, and next to the Pyramids, the Sphinx, and Karnak,
it is probably the most widely known of all Egyptian buildings. Recently
it has come very much to the front for an additional reason. Like all
the other temples of Philse, it had been archæologically surveyed and
cleared by Col. H. Gr. Lyons and Dr. Borchardt, but further work of a
far-reaching character was rendered necessary by the building of the
great Aswan dam, below the island of Philse, one of the results of
which has been the partial submergence of the island and its temples,
including the picturesque Kiosk. The following account, taken from the
new edition (1906) of Murray's <i>Guide to Egypt and the Sudan</i>, will
suffice better than any other description to explain what the dam is,
how it has affected Philse, and what work has been done to obviate the
possibility of serious damage to the Kiosk and other buildings.
</p>
<p>
"In 1898 the Egyptian government signed a contract with Messrs. John
Aird &amp; Co. for the construction of the great reservoir and dam at
Shellâl, which serves for the storage of water at the time of the flood
Nile. The river is 'held up' here sixty-five feet above its old normal
level. A great masonry dyke, 150 feet high in places, has been carried
across the Bab el-Kebir of the First Cataract, and a canal and four
locks, two hundred feet long and thirty feet wide, allow for the passage
of traffic up and down the river.

<pre>
Showing Water Rushing
Through The Sluices
</pre>
</div>



<p>
The dam is 2,185 yards long and over ninety feet thick at the base; in
places it rises one hundred feet above the bed of the river. It is built
of the local red granite, and at each end the granite dam is built into
the granite hillside. Seven hundred and eight thousand cubic yards of
masonry were used. The sluices are 180 in number, and are arranged at
four different levels. The sight of the great volume of water pouring
through them is a very fine one. The Nile begins to rise in July, and at
the end of November it is necessary to begin closing the sluice-gates
to hold up the water. By the end of February the reservoir is usually
filled and Philæ partially submerged, so that boats can sail in and out
of the colonnades and Pharaoh's Bed. By the beginning of July the water
has been distributed, and it then falls to its normal level.
</p>
<p>
"It is of course regrettable that the engineers were unable to find
another site for the dam, as it seemed inevitable that some damage would
result to the temples of Philæ from their partial submergence. Korosko
was proposed as a site, but was rejected for cogent reasons, and
apparently Shellâl was the only possible place. Further, no serious
person, who places the greatest good of the greatest number above
considerations of the picturesque and the 'interesting,' will deny
that if it is necessary to sacrifice Philæ to the good of the people of
Egypt, Philæ must go. 'Let the dead bury their dead.' The concern of the
rulers of Egypt must be with the living people of Egypt rather than with
the dead bones of the past; and they would not be doing their duty did
they for a moment allow artistic and archaeological considerations to
outweigh in their minds the practical necessities of the country. This
does not in the least imply that they do not owe a lesser duty to the
monuments of Egypt, which are among the most precious relics of the past
history of mankind. They do owe this lesser duty, and with regard to
Philae it has been conscientiously fulfilled. The whole temple, in order
that its stability may be preserved under the stress of submersion, has
been braced up and underpinned, under the superintendence of Mr. Ball,
of the Survey Department, who has most efficiently carried out this
important work, at a cost of £22,000.

<p>
Steel girders have been fixed across the island from quay to quay,
and these have been surrounded by cement masonry, made water-tight
by forcing in cement grout. Pharaoh's Bed and the colonnade have been
firmly underpinned in cement masonry, and there is little doubt that the
actual stability of Philae is now more certain than that of any other
temple in Egypt. The only possible damage that can accrue to it is
the partial discolouration of the lower courses of the stonework of
Pharaoh's Bed, etc., which already bear a distinct high-water mark. Some
surface disintegration from the formation of salt crystals is perhaps
inevitable here, but the effects of this can always be neutralized
by careful washing, which it should be an important charge of the
Antiquities Department to regularly carry out."

The photographs accompanying the present chapter show the dam, the Kiosk
in process of conservation and underpinning (1902), and the shores of
the island as they now appear in the month of November, with the water
nearly up to the level of the quays. A view is also given of the island
of Konosso, with its inscriptions, as it is now. The island is simply a
huge granite boulder of the kind characteristic of the neighbourhood of
Shellâl (Phila?) and Aswan.
</p>
<p>
On the island of Elephantine, opposite Aswan, an interesting discovery
has lately been made by Mr. Howard Carter. This is a remarkable well,
which was supposed by the ancients to lie immediately on the tropic. It
formed the basis of Eratosthenes' calculations of the measurement of the
earth. Important finds of documents written in Aramaic have also been
made here; they show that there was on the island in Ptolemaic times a
regular colony of Syrian merchants.
</p>
<p>
South of Aswan and Philse begins Nubia. The Nubian language, which is
quite different from Arabic, is spoken by everybody on the island of
Elephantine, and its various dialects are used as far south as Dongola,
where Arabic again is generally spoken till we reach the land of the
negroes, south of Khartum. In Ptolemaic and Roman days the Nubians were
a powerful people, and the whole of Nubia and the modern North Sudan
formed an independent kingdom, ruled by queens who bore the title or
name of Candace. It was the eunuch of a Candace who was converted to
Christianity as he was returning from a mission to Jerusalem to salute
Jehovah. "Go and join thyself unto his chariot" was the command to
Philip, and when the Ethiopian had heard the gospel from his lips he
went on his way rejoicing. The capital of this Candace was at Meroë, the
modern Bagarawiya, near Shendi. Here, and at Naga not far off, are
the remains of the temples of the Can-daces, great buildings of
semi-barbaric Egyptian style. For the civilization of the Nubians, such
as it was, was of Egyptian origin. Ever since Egyptian rule had been
extended southwards to Jebel Barkal, beyond Dongola, in the time of
Amenhetep II, Egyptian culture had influenced the Nubians. Amenhetep III
built a temple to Amen at Napatà, the capital of Nubia, which lay
under the shadow of Mount Barkal; Akhunaten erected a sanctuary of the
Sun-Disk there; and Ramses II also built there.

The place in fact was a sort of appanage of the priests of Amen at
Thebes, and when the last priest-king evacuated Thebes, leaving it to
the Bubastites of the XXIId Dynasty, it was to distant Napata that he
retired. Here a priestly dynasty continued to reign until, two centuries
later, the troubles and misfortunes of Egypt seemed to afford an
opportunity for the reassertion of the exiled Theban power. Piankhi
Mera-men returned to Egypt in triumph as its rightful sovereign, but his
successors, Shabak, Shabatak, and Tirha-kah, had to contend constantly
with the Assyrians. Finally ITrdamaneh, Tirhakah's successor, returned
to Nubia, leaving Egypt, in the decadence of the Assyrian might, free to
lead a quiet existence under Psametik I and the succeeding monarchs of
the XXVIth Dynasty. When Cambyses conquered Egypt he aspired to conquer
Nubia also, but his army was routed and destroyed by the Napatan king,
who tells us in an inscription how he defeated "the man Kambasauden,"
who had attacked him. At Napata the Nubian monarchs, one of the greatest
of whom in Ptolemaic times was Ergam-enes, a contemporary of Ptolemy
Philopator, continued to reign. But the first Roman governor of Egypt,
Ælius Gallus, destroyed Napata, and the Nubians removed their capital
to Meroë, where the Candaces reigned.

<p>
The monuments of this Nubian kingdom, the temples of Jebel Barkal, the
pyramids of Nure close by, the pyramids of Bagarawiya, the temples of
Wadi Ben Naga, Mesawwarat en-Naga, and Mesawwarat es-Sufra ("Mesawwarat"
proper), were originally investigated by Cailliaud and afterwards by
Lepsius. During the last few years they and the pyramids excavated by
Dr. E. A. Wallis-Budge, of the British Museum, for the Sudan government,
have been again explored. As the results of his work are not yet
fully published, it is possible at present only to quote the following
description from Cook's <i>Handbook for Egypt and the Sudan</i> (by Dr.
Budge), p. 6, of work on the pyramids of Jebel Barkal: "the writer
excavated the shafts of one of the pyramids here in 1897, and at the
depth of about twenty-five cubits found a group of three chambers, in
one of which were a number of bones of the sheep which was sacrificed
there about two thousand years ago, and also portions of a broken
amphora which had held Rho-dian wine. A second shaft, which led to the
mummy-chamber, was partly emptied, but at a further depth of twenty
cubits water was found. The high-water mark of the reservoir when full
is &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and, as there were no visible means for pumping it out, the
mummy-chamber could not be entered." With regard to the Bagarawîya
pyramids, Dr. Budge writes, on p. 700 of the same work, à propos of the
story of the Italian Ferlini that he found Roman jewelry in one of these
pyramids: "In 1903 the writer excavated a number of the pyramids of
Meroë for the Governor-General of the Sudan, Sir F. R. Wingate, and
he is convinced that the statements made by Ferlini are the result of
misapprehension on his part. The pyramids are solid throughout, and the
bodies are buried under them. When the details are complete the proofs
for this will be published." Dr. Budge has also written upon the subject
of the orientation of the Jebel Barkal and Nure pyramids.

It is very curious to find the pyramids reappearing in Egyptian
tomb-architecture in the very latest period of Egyptian history. We
find them when Egyptian civilization was just entering upon its vigorous
manhood, then they gradually disappear, only to revive in its decadent
and exiled old age. The Ethiopian pyramids are all of much more
elongated form than the old Egyptian ones. It is possible that they may
be a survival of the archaistic movement of the XXVIth Dynasty, to which
we have already referred.
</p>
<p>
These are not the latest Egyptian monuments in the Sudan, nor are the
temples of Naga and Mesawwarat the most ancient, though they belong
to the Roman period and are decidedly barbarian as to their style and,
especially, as to their decoration. The southernmost as well as latest
relic of Egypt in the Sudan is the Christian church of Soba, on the Blue
Mie, a few miles above Khartum. In it was found a stone ram, an emblem
of Amen-Râ, which had formerly stood in the temple of Naga and had been
brought to Soba perhaps under the impression that it was the Christian
Lamb. It was removed to the garden of the governor-general's palace at
Khartum, where it now stands.
</p>
<p>
The church at Soba is a relic of the Christian kingdom of Alua, which
succeeded the realm of the Candaces. One of its chief seats was at
Dongola, and all Nubia is covered with the ruins of its churches. It
was, of course, an offshoot of the Christianity of Egypt, but a late
one, since Isis was still worshipped at Philse in the sixth century,
long after the Edict of Theodosius had officially abolished paganism
throughout the Roman world, and the Nubians were at first zealous
votaries of the goddess of Philo. So also when Egypt fell beneath the
sway of the Moslem in the seventh century, Nubia remained an independent
Christian state, and continued so down to the twelfth century, when the
soldiers of Islam conquered the country.
</p>
<p>
Of late pagan and early Christian Egypt very much that is new has been
discovered during the last few years. The period of the Lower Empire
has yielded much to the explorers of Oxyrrhynchus, and many papyri of
interest belonging to this period have been published by Mr. Kenyon in
his <i>Catalogue of the Greek Papyri in the British Museum</i>, especially
the letters of Flavius Abinæus, a military officer of the fourth
century. The papyri of this period are full of the high-flown titles
and affected phraseology which was so beloved of Byzantine scribes.
"Glorious Dukes of the Thebaïd," "most magnificent counts and
lieutenants," "all-praiseworthy secretaries," and the like strut across
the pages of the letters and documents which begin "In the name of Our
Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, the God and Saviour of us all, in
the year x of the reign of the most divine and praised, great, and
beneficent Lord Flavius Heraclius (or other) the eternal Augustus and
Auto-krator, month x, year x of the In diction." It is an extraordinary
period, this of the sixth and seventh centuries, which we have now
entered, with its bizarre combination of the official titulary of
the divine and eternal Cæsars Imperatores Augusti with the initial
invocation of Christ and the Trinity. It is the transition from the
ancient to the modern world, and as such has an interest all its own.
</p>
<p>
In Egypt the struggle between the adherents of Chalcedon, the "Melkites"
or Imperialists of the orthodox Greek rite, and the Eutychians or
Mono-physites, the followers of the patriarch Dioskoros, who rejected
Chalcedon, was going on with unabated fury, and was hardly stopped even
by the invasion of the pagan Persians. The last effort of the party of
Constantinople to stamp out the Monophysite heresy was made when Cyril
was patriarch and governor of Egypt. According to an ingenious theory
put forward by Mr. Butler, in his <i>Arab Conquest of Egypt</i>, it is Cyril
the patriarch who was the mysterious Mukaukas, the [Greek word], or
"Great and Magnificent One," who played so doubtful a part in the
epoch-making events of the Arab conquest by Amr in A.D. 639-41. Usually
this Mukaukas has been regarded as a "noble Copt," and the Copts have
generally been credited with having assisted the Islamites against
the power of Constantinople. This was a very natural and probable
conclusion, but Mr. Butler will have it that the Copts resisted the
Arabs valiantly, and that the treacherous Mukaukas was none other than
the Constantinopolitan patriarch himself.
</p>
<p>
In the papyri it is interesting to note the gradual increase of Arab
names after the conquest, more especially in those of the Archduke
Rainer 's collection from the Fayyûm, which was so near the new capital
city, Fustât. In Upper Egypt the change was not noticeable for a long
time, and in the great collection of Coptic <i>ostraka</i> (inscriptions on
slips of limestone and sherds of pottery, used as a substitute for paper
or parchment), found in the ruins of the Coptic monastery established,
on the temple site of Dêr el-Bahari, we find no Arab names. These
documents, part of which have been published by Mr. W. E. Crum for the
Egypt Exploration Fund, while another part will shortly be issued for
the trustees of the British Museum by Mr. Hall, date to the seventh and
eighth centuries. Their contents resemble those of the earlier papyri
from Oxyrrhynchus, though they are not of so varied a nature and are
generally written by persons of less intelligence, i.e. the monks and
peasants of the monasteries and villages of Tjême, or Western Thebes.
During the late excavation of the XIth Dynasty temple of Dêr el-Bahari,
more of these <i>ostraka</i> were found, which will be published for the
Egypt Exploration Fund by Messrs. Naville and Hall. Of actual buildings
of the Coptic period the most important excavations have been those of
the French School of Cairo at Bâwît, north of Asyût. This work, which
was carried on by M. Jean Clédat, has resulted in the discovery of very
important frescoes and funerary inscriptions, belonging to the monastery
of a famous martyr, St. Apollo. With these new discoveries of Christian
Egypt our work reaches its fitting close. The frontier which divides the
ancient from the modern world has almost been crossed. We look back from
the monastery of Bâwît down a long vista of new discoveries until, four
thousand years before, we see again the Great Heads coming to the Tomb
of Den, Narmer inspecting the bodies of the dead Northerners, and,
far away in Babylonia, Narâm-Sin crossing the mountains of the East to
conquer Elam, or leading his allies against the prince of Sinai.
